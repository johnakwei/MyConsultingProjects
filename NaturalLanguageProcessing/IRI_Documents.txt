Establishing University-Industry Joint Ventures

Richard Cyert, Sixth President of Carnegie-Mellon University (1977-1990)

Agreements like that between Westinghouse and Carnegie-Mellon can help surmount the obstacles to significant research cooperation between corporations and universities.

Richard M. Cyert, President, Carnegie-Mellon University (#TBT article originally published in 1985)

In talking with corporate executives, I find that most of them see the importance of an environment in which corporations and universities are cooperating much more closely. This attitude has developed in part from an increased appreciation for basic research, stemming from the recognition that the United States no longer has a technological lead on the rest of the world.

In any event, the increased level of cooperation between universities and corporations in research must overcome two major hurdles. The first one comes from the corporation and represents the need for the corporation to have something tangible to show for tis research expenditures when justifying such expenditures to stock holders. This tangible item is a patent. Corporations must be in a position to receive patents for significant expenditures of funds. Traditionally, universities have coveted the patent rights for any research undertaken in the university. Most universities have strict patent policies in which the university retains some rights from the patent. This policy is motivated by the dream that someday a patent will enrich the university beyond its wildest expectations. The fact that one or two schools have had such experiences stimulates the desire for patents on the part of others.

The obstacle to cooperative research at the university is the need for publication. A major mission of a research university is the development of new knowledge and the obligation to make this new knowledge available to other researchers. This obligation, for example, is so strong at Carnegie-Mellon University that there has been a policy forbidding undertaking secret research that goes back to the early 1950s.

These two obstacles, then, would seem to be so great that significant cooperation on research between universities and corporations would be impossible. Universities want both the patents and the right to publish. Corporations want the patent rights and have difficulty with publications since it might well endanger the attainment of patent rights. Obviously, a change in attitude on both sides is critical, and I believe the type of agreement that has been developed between Westinghouse Corporation and Carnegie-Mellon to stimulate research in robotics represents a model that is possible in this area.

The agreement I refer to gives Westinghouse the patent rights to any discoveries that are made in the course of the research—whether by Westinghouse employees or Carnegie-Mellon University faculty. If  Westinghouse licenses these patents, then Carnegie-Mellon receives a percentage of the royalties. On the other hand, Carnegie-Mellon University has the right to publish although it agrees to withhold publication for a limited period of time if such publication would endanger the patent. This arrangement, a relatively simple one, opens the road to a free interchange between universities and corporations. Under this system universities can develop research relationships with corporations that can benefit both organizations. The corporation gains considerably by an association with outstanding researchers whom it probably could not hire. The university also gains by this arrangement since it gets some funding for basic research. In addition, the academic researchers get a flow of problems from the real world that can be important. One of the defects of any discipline is the tendency to work on problems in the literature that may not have any meaningful counterpart in the real world. Almost every well-developed discipline suffers from this characteristic.

The mutual advantages available to the corporation and the university enable me to classify this type of agreement as a joint venture in the same sense as a joint venture between two industrial firms. It is incumbent upon the university administration to treat this joint venture in a business-like way. The university and the corporation must have frequent meetings to review the research project, and it is vital that both parties get the desired returns from this arrangement.

Developing Commercial Products Faster

The NSF [National Science Foundation] on occasion has sponsored research to determine the time required to develop an idea in the laboratory to a commercial product. These studies have established a range of approximately 13 to 18 years.

One of the objectives of greater cooperation between universities and corporations should be to shorten this period. At Carnegie-Mellon, we have attempted to structure some of our joint research with industry to facilitate the movement of products to the market. The format is one in which industry employees will work on the project in Carnegie-Mellon labs at least part of the time. Conversely, faculty members at CMU will work in company facilities and visit the relevant factories.

The members of each group, corporate and university, must develop an understanding of the other’s attitudes, goals, and work habits. Mutual understanding must be established by each side working closely together and participating in activities that are not part of the regular routine. Academics must be willing to get their hands “dirty,” and industry people must be prepared to appreciate abstract reasoning and attempts to generalize.

The end results can be worth the effort. In one joint project between Carnegie-Mellon and Westinghouse, a completely automated cell for the production of turbine blades was successfully installed and working in approximately 2 ½ years. The cell was designed and developed from scratch. New machinery had to be designed and fabricated and much software written. The successful completion of the project required the kind of mutual understanding described above.

Developing Consortia

Other arrangements are also possible and desirable. I believe that universities can play a vital role in developing consortia of firms in the same industry who are interested in research.

The progress which the Japanese have made in many industries has become one of the marvels of the seventies and promises to continue in the eighties. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry, (MITI), has played a significant role in Japan’s progress by organizing consortia of firms to d joint research in various fields.

In the United States we have viewed research in industry as another aspect of the competitive system. Firms have not been allowed to work together on research since cooperative ventures are threatened by anti-trust laws. The aim of each firm is to find a breakthrough that will give its product a comparative advantage over the others in the field.

If one looks at the research process closely, however, a valid inference to draw is that research is a cooperative venture. Each researcher literally “stands on the shoulders” of his or her predecessors in the field. A strong argument can be made that there are advantages from cooperation in research. On an a priori basis it would seem highly desirable and beneficial to have researchers from a variety of organizations working cooperatively. The ability to assimilate a variety of ideas and approaches could have a beneficial approach to research. In Japan the consortia organized by MITI function in just this way. The firms work together on research, and each company that participates in the consortium is able to get royalty-free licenses on any of the patented discoveries. The consortium at some point is disbanded, and the firms return to competing with each other in all aspects of their activities. In the United States we have not had the opportunity to try research in this fashion. Currently, there are some attempts by industry to move in this direction.

However, the greatest potential by far for organizing cooperation in research lies with universities. The possibility that various universities individually can function in the way that MITI does holds great promise for the United States. I envisage a situation in which the university, after analyzing its capabilities, focuses on those areas in which it has research strengths. It then organizes the firms that have a stake in these fields. A consortium is then organized in a particular field. The industries supply the funds needed to do the research, and the university contributes its fair share through the use of its space, equipment, supplies, and faculty. The consortium should operate in a way that gives the industrial members an advisory role in developing a relevant research program with the university retaining veto power on the research. Some firms would send researchers to the university laboratories for a certain time, and the university would hold periodic conferences to report results of the research. In the interim, working papers and progress reports by the research director would keep firms up-to-date. The university would take out all patents, with the members of the consortium receiving royalty-free licenses.

Clearly, the research can be done only when there are faculty members within the university interested in the research. Some of the research will have to provide relatively quick payoffs to satisfy management and stakeholders of firms. It is also clear that much of the research has to be basic if the United States is going to maintain a position that is on the cutting edge of world competition.

This type of cooperative research could be made significantly stronger if the National Science foundation were to start a program to grant funds directly to the university for those consortia that pass the NSF peer-review system. The university then would be in as powerful a position as MITI to leverage the dollars of the individual firms.

In conclusion, The United States has a potentially large comparative advantage, in that industries and universities can and do cooperate. No other country has this kind of relationship to the degree present here. Universities can take the leadership in this matter and make a major contribution to our society.

Abstract
Employee retention is a critical issue for business leaders. The United States Bureau of
Labor Statistics reported over 4.5 million employee separations in 2014 because of
resignations, layoffs, or terminations. Hospitality managers face some of the lowest
employee retention rates of any industry, which leads to poor customer satisfaction and
decreased profitability. The purpose of this multiple case study was to explore the
perceptions of 3 hospitality managers from 3 different mid-sized hospitality organizations
in Brevard County, Florida. The conceptual framework for this study was built upon
motivation theory; existence, relatedness, and growth theory; and expectancy theory. The
data were collected through document and artifact review, a reflective journal, and
semistructured interviews. Member checking was completed to strengthen credibility and
trustworthiness of the interpretation of the participants’ responses. Four themes emerged
from the data: the motivational outcome, leadership characteristics, most effective
retention strategies, and the least effective strategies influencing employee retention. The
findings from this study may educate inform hospitality managers on how to stabilize
employment, improve retention, and increase customer satisfaction and profitability.

Section 1: Foundation of the Study
Business leaders in the 2014 labor market placed emphasis on attracting and
retaining employees that were being lost to competitors or other career opportunities
(Ramlall, 2012; Singh, Dev, & Mandelbaum, 2014). Guilding, Lamminaki, and
McManus (2014) argued that hospitality organizations experience higher than average
levels of employee turnover. More leaders in these organizations are increasingly
acknowledging just how costly it is to replace an employee rather than retain the
employee (Guilding et al., 2014). The purpose of this multiple case study was to explore
strategies needed by hospitality managers to retain employees.
Background of the Problem
Employee retention is a challenge that can affect the success of an industry
(Guilding et al., 2014). Employee retention and turnover crises have been emerging in the
21st century for many businesses, including hospitality (Gursoy, Rahman, & Swanger,
2012). Retention in the hospitality industry is a continuing and ever-evolving effort to
retain the best available labor talent (Han & Hyun, 2015; Karatepe, 2013) as hospitality
managers face the challenge of managing a constantly changing workforce (Alexakis,
2011). Researchers noted that some managers have either not addressed the problem of
employee retention or have attempted to address the problem with little success
(Alexakis, 2011; Kucukusta, Denizci Guillet, & Lau, 2014). Robinson, Kralj, Solnet,
Goh, and Callan (2014) concluded that employees will stay with an organization if given
a combination of retention strategies that can make leaving seem less than advantageous.
2
Problem Statement
Low employee retention in hospitality organizations results in the loss of
thousands of dollars with the departure of their most valuable asset, human capital
(Freedman & Kosová, 2014). The U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (2014) reported 4.5
million total employee separations in 2014 attributed to employee turnover for reasons
such as quitting, layoffs, and discharges. The general business problem is the inability of
some hospitality managers to retain employees at the workplace which results in a loss of
customer satisfaction and profitability. The specific business problem was that some
hospitality managers lack strategies to improve employee retention.
Purpose Statement
The purpose of this qualitative multiple case study was to explore the strategies
hospitality managers need to improve employee retention. The population consisted of
experienced hospitality managers in Brevard County, Florida, who implemented
strategies to improve employee retention. Three experienced hospitality managers with
supervision and hiring responsibilities from mid-sized hospitality organizations
participated. Hospitality managers were appropriate for this study because these
managers were most suited to identify the strategies hospitality managers need to
improve employee retention with the consideration of real-life experiences. I also
collected and analyzed documents and I used a reflective journal to methodologically
triangulate the data. The implications for positive social change included possible
changes to impact business practices by providing hospitality managers strategies needed
for improving employee retention, thus improving the stability of and customers’ 
3
experiences with their organizations (Malik & Usman, 2011).
Nature of the Study
The research method for this study was qualitative. An advantage of the
qualitative method is the researcher studies participants in their lived environments (Eide
& Showalter, 2012). Quantitative methods do not include a collection of detailed
information on the lived experiences of research participants (Sinkovics & Alfoldi,
2012). A quantitative approach was not appropriate for this study because I was not
seeking to determine a cause-and-effect relationship (Barratt, Choi, & Li, 2011). A
mixed-methods approach consists of both qualitative and quantitative research designs,
enabling a researcher to seek the information needed to solve a problem instead of
identifying the problem’s cause (Sparkes, 2014).
Multiple case studies are used to explore a phenomenon by comparing a target
population’s differences and similarities (Stake, 1995) and based on multiple sources of
evidence (Yin, 2014) which was the intent of this study. Other qualitative designs
considered for this study were phenomenology, ethnography, and narrative inquirers. A
phenomenology study is a study of human experience from the view of those living the
phenomenon (Robertson & Thompson, 2014), which was not the intent of this study.
Ethnography inquirers study groups of individuals and their cultures (Gioia, Corley, &
Hamilton, 2012); based on the criteria for an ethnography study, I did not choose an
ethnography apporach. Narrative inquirers collect stories, group conversations, and
documents as the primary sources of data to make meaning of what is happening in a
phenomenon (Wells, 2011). The narrative inquirers did not meet the needs of this study.

Research Question
The research question for this study, which I developed to contribute to the body
of knowledge on employee retention, was as follows: What strategies do hospitality
managers need to improve employee retention?
Interview Questions
In this study, I focused on my interview questions to explore the strategies
hospitality managers need to improve employee retention. The interviews questions I
used to interview managers for this proposed study are as follows:
Interview Questions
1. What employee motivational factors and leadership characteristics do you use
to retain employees in your hospitality organization?
Follow up question: What are some of the reasons these motivational factors
and leadership characteristics apply to retaining employees in the hospitality
organization?
2. What strategies have you used to retain employees in the hospitality
organization?
3. Which of these strategies have you implemented to retain employees in the
organization?
4. Which of these strategies helped to improve employee retention?
Follow up question: Why do these strategies help to improve employee
retention?
5. Which of these strategies did not help to improve employee retention?
5
Follow up question: Why did these strategies not improve employee
retention?
Conceptual Framework
Maslow’s motivation theory (1943), Alderfer’s existence, relatedness, and growth
(ERG) theory (1969), and Vroom’s expectancy theory (1964) are used in both academic
and professional practice to predict employee motivation (Kessler, 2013). Researchers
have offered that various conceptual frameworks for understanding employees’
motivational needs (Kessler, 2013; Russ, 2011; Sebastian & Davison, 2011). A manager
may inspire an employee’s decision to retain employment within an organization
depending on the leadership style they practice (Kessler, 2013; Russ, 2011; Sebastian &
Davison, 2011). The use of these frameworks broadly conceptualizes the intersections
between managers’ perceptions of human nature and their approaches to motivating
others in organizational settings (Russ, 2011). As a result, key constructs or propositions
underlying the frameworks are the leadership styles used by the managers to retain
employees (Kessler, 2013). In this study, I asked each hospitality manager to describe the
strategies he or she has implemented to retain employees. As recommended for
qualitative studies by Yin (2014), I used multiple sources of data to maximize the range
of data needed to contribute to my understanding of the patterns and themes of the
phenomenon. I examined the motivation needs theory; existence, relatedness, growth
theory; and expectancy theory on strategies to improve employee retention. I tied each of
the concepts in the study to strategies used to improve employee retention to develop a
better understanding and analyze ongoing situational reality experiences (Proietti, 2012; 
6
Sebastian & Davison, 2011; Yin, 2014). In the literature review, I included details about
each of these theories that I used as the conceptual framework for this proposed study.
Operational Definitions
Employee retention. Employee retention is the ability of an organization to retain
its employees (Cardy & Lengnick-Hall, 2011).
Employee turnover. Employee turnover is a voluntary separation act initiated by
an employer or employee after establishing employment for any length of time (Chalkiti,
2012).
Epoché. Epoché, or bracketing, is a technique used by a researcher to mitigate
bias that he or she may have regarding phenomena they seek to research (Moustakas,
1994). In general, the researcher brackets out their experiences about the phenomenon
prior to exploring the phenomenon as in an effort to identify any potential bias that he or
she may have prior to observing the phenomenon. When the researcher has an awareness
of potential biases, the researcher can set them aside to their view the phenomenon under
study from a fresh perspective (Moustakas, 1994).
Hospitality industry. The hospitality industry is a business sector that provides
services, such as food, drink, and lodging to an individual or group of people outside of a
private home (Chon, Barrows, & Bosselman, 2013).
Job satisfaction. Job satisfaction is the manner and passion a worker expresses
from internal and external drivers; it is how an individual feels toward his or her
performance at a job (Ghorbanian, Bahadori, & Nejati, 2012).
Leader. A leader is an individual who leads, supports, and inspires others to 
7
achieve goals established by an organization’s direction (Owens & Hekman, 2012).
Leadership style. Leadership style is a method by which an organizer directs,
mentors, supervises, and oversees appointed subordinates within an organization
(Caruthers, 2011).
Manager. A manager is an individual who is responsible for directing, planning,
and coordinating resources in support of attaining organizational goals (Gittell &
Douglass, 2012).
Assumptions, Limitations, and Delimitations
During the development of this study, certain critical self-reflections were
established and recognized to set the boundaries of this study (Merriam, 2014). A
researcher provides background data for establishing the context of a study and a detailed
description of the phenomenon in question; researchers can transfer the context to future
research settings (Marshall & Rossman, 2011). The following is a summary of the
assumptions, limitations, and delimitations for this study.
Assumptions
Assumptions in a study are underlying perspectives assumed to be probably true
by the researcher; otherwise, the study may not progress (Foss & Hallerg, 2013; Merriam,
2014). The basis of this study included five assumptions. The first assumption was
retention strategies continue to be important in hospitality organizations in Brevard
County, Florida. The second assumption in the study was the use of multiple sources of
data were the best approach for collecting data. I used semistructured interviews as well
as gathered, analyzed, and triangulated other data, such as company employee retention 
8
documents, to develop an answer to the research question that I proposed for this study.
The third assumption was the population of hospitality managers in this study was
appropriate for exploring common themes involving the employee retention strategies in
the hospitality industry. The fourth assumption in this study was that a qualitative
multiple case study approach was the best research design. Multiple case study designs
are used to study a phenomenon in a natural setting, or determining what happened or
why it happened (Yin, 2014). The fifth assumption was that the hospitality managers
provided complete answers to my questions and provided me with the most current
documents that I needed to complete the case study. Based on researchers’ descriptions
and past uses of qualitative methods and multiple case study designs, I assumed that a
qualitative multiple case study was the best-suited research design for the study.
Limitations
Leedy and Ormrod (2013) concluded that limitations in a study are potential
weaknesses that are out of the researcher’s control. The findings from this study reflected
the perceptions of only the managers interviewed and not those of other managers on the
organization leadership team in other deapartments within the organization. I limited the
study population to the selected managers in hospitality organizations in the study area.
In many cases, an organization's confidentiality requirements limited the quality and
details of the responses that participants provided. In addition, the data for this study were
collected from managers in a limited geographic area in a particular industry and may not
represent the views and experiences of hospitality managers in other geographic
locations.
9
Delimitations
Delimitations of this study are characteristics that limit the scope and define the
boundaries of the study within a researcher’s control (Thomas, Nelson, & Silverman,
2011). The study included five interview questions with follow-up probing questions that
I presented to three study participants. The study participants were managers in their
respective companies with a minimum of 5 years of experience in hospitality
management. The study participants served in a role as a manager in a hospitality
organization in Brevard County, Florida, possessed at minimum a bachelor’s degree, and
were at least 18 years of age with experience in implementing employee retention
strategies. I did not interview subordinates for their opinions of the study participants’
retention strategies. Likewise, I did not solicit any other employees of the organizations
to share their opinions. The results of this study may not be transferable to managers and
employees of other hospitality organizations within Brevard County, Florida or in other
regions of the United States.
Significance of the Study
An assessment of the values of this study is to help business leaders distinguish
one potential critical focus in their business environment. Managers, stakeholders, and
scholar-practitioners may find this study helpful to understand effective retention
strategies. An analysis of the contribution to business practices and implication for social
change could provide industry leaders with a foundation for developing and
implementing employee retention strategies. It was my hope that this study offered a
comprehensive overview of findings and discussions on the service hospitality industry
10
and hospitality leadership. Another contribution of studying this phenomenon, according
to Leung, Law, van Hoof, and Buhalis (2014), is to provide an agenda for future research
on retention strategies in service and hospitality.
Contribution to Business Practice
Employees make beneficial contributions to a business and increase the
profitability of an organization (Gruman & Saks, 2011).Few companies remain
competitive when having to spend more resournce to develop human resources than on
customer services (Daskin & Tezer, 2012). The findings from this study may contribute
to improving business practice by providing information that may have a substantial
effect on employee retention, as well as raise organizational leaders’ awareness and
understanding of employee retention strategies. Hospitality managers may be able to use
the findings to explore the potential causes of employee turnover and implement
strategies for improved retention. The results of this study may also benefit managers in
other organizational leadership positions by providing strategies they can implement to
improve employee retention.
Implications for Social Change
Regardless of the industry, a high employee retention rate influences the culture
of an organization (Ladelsky & Catană, 2013). Managers can attempt to foster greater
loyalty among employees which can help organizations remain successful even in
challenging economic times (Gursoy et al., 2012). The findings from this case study may
be used to contribute to positive social change by providing information on employee
retention strategies that could help stabilize employment and improve services to 
11
customers in hospitality organizations. Understanding the strategies hospitality managers
are practicing to retain employees is essential in ensuring that hospitality organizations
gain a comprehension of the factors that influence retention so that they can control
turnover in their organization (Ghapanchi & Aurum, 2011).
A Review of the Professional and Academic Literature
Employee retention is a leading concern in business (Gruman & Saks, 2011). By
showing some of the factors that affect an employee’s intentions to leave an organization,
managers may address those factors to avoid unplanned turnover (Das, 2012). The
purpose of this qualitative multiple case study was to explore the strategies hospitality
managers need to improve employee retention. Waight and Madera (2011) linked
employee retention to job satisfaction and the job environment, such as increased levels
of responsibility and challenging tasks. Exploring retention strategies may enhance
productivity and social responsibility as well as improve company morale, job
satisfaction, and retention of an organization’s employees (Khaliki, 2014).
The purpose of this literature review was to present a critical synthesis of
historical and current research concerning the conceptual framework, the service and
hospitality sector, employee motivations, leadership styles, employee retention strategies,
and leadership. The Walden University Library and Google Scholar databases produced
valuable information for the literature review. The research databases utilized included
ERIC, ProQuest, Business Info Source, and SAGE Journals. The search words included
leadership, strategy, leadership skills, retention, job satisfaction, recruitment,
organizational culture, turnover, leadership traits, practical results, and high-performing 
12
employee. The literature gathering process included the use of peer-reviewed journal
articles, seminal books, and relevant governmental websites. The use of multiple sources
ensured scholarship, rigor, and depth. Of the total of 156 unique sources referenced in the
literature review, 148 are current, peer-reviewed research articles published from 2011 to
2015 (see Table 1).

To investigate common themes among researchers, the peer-reviewed articles
included qualitative and quantitative studies. Researchers employ literature maps to
outline a visual summary of the literature used to explore a topic (Rahmandoust et al.,
2011). Through outlining general headings and subheadings, literature maps assist
researchers to determine connections between subjects and highlight research gaps
(Rahmandoust et al., 2011). I organized the literature using a concept map with six topic
hierarchies, including the conceptual framework, the service and hospitality industry
sector, employee motivations, the effects of leadership, current knowledge on employee 
13
retention within the limitation of this phenomenon, and the need for employee retention
strategies. I explored five of the topics in suborder themes to illuminate employee
retention strategies further. Synthesis of the suborder themes then led to consideration of
additional elements for building an employee-centered environment and different
leadership styles. Throughout the literature review, the conceptual framework of:
Maslow’s (1943) motivation theory; Alderfer’s (1969) ERG theory; and, Vroom’s (1964)
expectancy theory are presented to justify and explain other researchers’ perspectives on
strategies hospitality managers need to retain employees.
Conceptual Framework
I incorporated the theoretical framework of: Maslow’s (1943) motivation theory
(1943); Alderfer’s (1969) ERG theory; and, Vroom’s (1964) expectancy theory as the
study’s conceptual framework. Alderfer’s, Maslow’s, and Vroom’s early theoretical
foundations emphasized employee retention through motivation, management support,
and workplace fulfillment; factors that continue to affect hospitality industry employee
retention worldwide (Ramlall, 2012). Prior motivational viewpoints (Alderfer, 1969;
Maslow, 1943) were pertinent to a rigorous exploration of employee retention strategies.
Latukha (2011) argued that understanding retention strategies are essential to retain
employees in the workplace. In the following sections, I presented a conceptual
framework synthesis for employee motivation, employee engagement, satisfying human
needs, and leadership topics.
Motivation theory. Maslow (1943) theorized that people have basic needs for
growth and development that must be satisfied. Maslow identified the individual needs as 
14
(a) physiological, (b) safety, (c) social, (d) esteem, and (e) self-actualization. Maslow
proposed an individual must attain lower needs, such as safety, before the higher needs
like esteem, thereby leading to self-actualization. He identified an important limitation to
the achievement of self-actualization that each human need must be addressed in a fixed
hierarchy without variation. For example, an employee may work to fulfill needs more
complex than the physiological and neglect to address that need area properly (Boyd,
2014). Blower and Mahajan (2013) found that nelecting the needs of internal and external
stakeholders can prove fatal for the success of an organization.
The application of Maslow’s (1943) motivational theory to the context of
employee retention, according to Shuck and Herd (2012), was that a manager does not
necessarily do the work of meeting an employee’s needs; rather an employee is motivated
by their lowest level of unsatisfied need. Consideration of Maslow’s motivational theory
provided a critical link between an employee’s work motivation and a manager’s
continuous adaptation to employees’ changing needs to keep their workforce motivated
(Shuck & Herd, 2012). A complete understanding of the full need framework might
underpin employee retention (Maslow, 1943; Shuck & Herd, 2012). An employee’s
external values and unmet needs could hinder the achievement of self-actualization
within a work environment (Boyd, 2014). Fassin (2012) procalimed that an individual’s
external values are affected by the actions of an organizational manager that lacks
strategies to improve employee retention, social groups, and associations. Maslow (1943)
found that people change to fulfill the individual need for personal growth. The unique
motivation for self-actualization causes individuals to pursue need resolution (Maslow,
15
1943). For example, one employee may need job security while another seeks
professional support to fulfill a need (Russ, 2011). There is no particular trigger or form
that an employee need might take place in the workplace as personal needs vary
(Maslow, 1943). Kellerman (2013) concluded geographic locations have been ignored
when discussing Maslow’s motivation theory because human needs, the demand for basic
needs, and meeting those needs are not achieved thoroughly in the workplace.
Researchers and business leaders implement or criticize Maslow’s theory of motivation
(Kellerman, 2013). For the purpose of exploring employee retention strategies, using
Maslow’s theory as a conceptual framework sufficed for an initial examination of the
satisfaction of human needs.
Existence, relatedness, and growth (ERG) theory. Alderfer (1969) concluded
that there are three needs that dominant in the workplace: existence, relatedness, and
growth. Alderfer’s ERG theory included a limitation similar to Maslow’s theory yet
incorporated flexible movement between needs (Guillén, Ferrero, & Hoffman, 2014).
Alderfer defined existence needs as physiological and safety needs, which an employer
met by providing safe working conditions and earnings (Alderfer, 1969; Steidle, Gockel,
& Werth, 2013). Relatedness needs are a person's actions to maintain meaningful
interpersonal relationships, including those with workplace colleagues and managers
(Alderfer, 1969; Steidle et al., 2013). Growth needs reflect a person’s desire for selffulfillment through finding opportunities to be productive and creative by working on
meaningful tasks (Alderfer, 1969; Steidle et al., 2013). I used Alderfer’s ERG theory as a
conceptual framework to enhance my understanding of potential employee retention 
16
strategies.
To benefit from an implementation of ERG theory (Alderfer, 1969) required that
hospitality managers simultaneously recognize an employee's multiple needs of
existence, relatedness, and growth (Russ, 2011). Managers that identified the various
ERG needs that drive an employee understood an employee’s behavior and worked
towards motivating them (Alderfer, 1969; Russ, 2011). Alderfer (1969) proposed that if a
manager concentrated only on one employee, another might regress due to frustration.
Although a manager may provide work-related fulfillment of needs, if the employee's
nonwork related needs are not met the employee could leave the organization (Steidle et
al., 2013). Managers can aim for security and fulfilling their obligations to all employees
in the workplace (Steidle et al., 2013).
Researchers have questioned whether ERG is more applicable to organizations
that experience occasional employee retention challenges (Altman, Valenzi, & Hodgetts,
2013). Managers who focus exclusively on one need at a time will not effectively
motivate the employee (Guillén et al., 2014). The application of Alderfer’s (1969) ERG
theory may be valid, however, organizational leaders who considered the use of the ERG
reported very few everyday uses when seeking to retain multiple workers (Konrad,
Moore, Doherty, Ng, & Breward, 2012). Researchers concluded that developing a range
of strategies that address employees’ various motivational drivers can foster a sustainable
workforce (Altman et al., 2013; Kara, Uysal, Sirgy, & Lee, 2013). In response to
Maslow’s (1943) motivation theory and Alderfer’s (1969) ERG theory, Vroom’s
expectancy theory was based on the premise that an individual's motivation can become 
17
affected by an anticipated outcome of their actions (Vroom, 1964).
Expectancy theory. The relationship between an individual employee’s
motivation and work-related behavior attracted research attention (Jodlbauer, Selenko,
Batinic, & Stiglbauer, 2012). Vroom’s (1964) expectancy theory concentrated on the
effort-performance relationship, the performance-reward relationship, and rewarded
personal goal relationships. Vroom recommended focusing motivation efforts on
understanding how and why people make decisions to satisfy maximum pleasure with
minimum pain (Vroom, 1964). Vroom’s expectancy theory stresses outcomes, unlike
Maslow (1943) and Alderfer (1969) who focused on human needs (Kessler, 2013).
Vroom did not explain what motivated individuals, but rather how individuals
made decisions to achieve a valued end they desired (Purvis, Zagenczyk, & McCray,
2015). Kessler (2013) found that organizational reward systems must be fair and just to
be of value to employees. An employee's level of commitment or effort can change based
on their perceived value of the rewards being offered (Kessler, 2013). If an employee
perceived that his or her increased efforts did not increase the intrinsic or extrinsic
reward, the employee was unlikely to value the reward (Gupta & Shaw, 2014). Russ
(2011) noted that employees who did not perceive the reward as something of value
could decide to leave the organization. Hospitality managers can design engaging,
dynamic, and challenging jobs to ensure that employees feel rewarded for their
performance (Downes & Choi, 2014; Purvis et al., 2015).

Service and Hospitality Industry Sector
Researchers found it a challenge to define the two concentrations of service and
hospitality (Kandampully, Keating, Kim, Mattila, & Solnet, 2014). Defining both of these
terms was a challenge due to the lack of consensus (Kandampully et al., 2014). A detailed
analysis of the discussion surrounding the evolving nature and definitions of service and
hospitality was outside the scope of this research. A review of current debates indicated
that a commonly accepted simple definition of hospitality and service does not exist
(Kandampully et al., 2014; Symons, 2013). Researchers have provided the essential
aspects to frame contributions and subsequent reviews (Kandampully et al., 2014; Magilo
& Spohrer, 2013), including measurement of the service phenomena (Magilo & Spohrer,
2013; Prakash & Mohanty, 2013).
Hospitality organizations. Teng (2013) described a hospitality organization as
one with a purpose to satisfy a full range of needs such as food, beverages, and
accommodations. The hospitality industry involves frequent guest–host interactions and
hospitality organizations cater to the needs of diverse customer groups (Teng, 2013).
Symons (2013) considered that a possible definition of hospitality as a custom,
obligation, pleasure, and performance industry. Darling (2014) noted that the term
hospitality is simultaneously a vague and massive concept. Existing literature does yet
encompass the distinctions of host and guest relationships found in an interactional
setting (Kirillova, Gilmetdinova, & Lehto, 2014). Hospitality is an underlying aspect of
organizations and customers interacting in a service context (Thirkettle & Korstanje,
2013). Kirillova et al. (2014) attributed that the definition challenges to perspective, with 
19
hospitality as a product, a process, experience, or all three.
Prior scholars have already described the significance and implications of
hospitality employee retention (Banhwa, Chipunza, & Chamisa, 2014; Cascio, 2014).
Teng (2013) noted that little research focused on essential elements of leadership roles in
hospitality management to enhance management professionals’ competency and benefit
the industry by teaching retention skills. Nwosu (2014) found that a robust approach to
credentialing and training the future hospitality workforce would support organizational
leaders to retain a competent service workforce. Hospitality managers can gain an
understanding of the efforts of other organization leaders who have implemented
effective retention strategies, which may result in higher employee retention and lower
turnover in the hospitality workforce.
Defining service in the hospitality industry. The definition of service is
constantly changing because customer values are impacted by competitive shifts
(Kandampully et al., 2014). For example, services rendered in a hospitality organization
might encompass satisfaction linked to a sale of tangible goods (Kandampully et al.,
2014). King, So, and Grace (2013) noted that a service is difficult to define and capture.
Services offered by an organization are as different from each other as products they
offer; the definition of service is constrained and dependent on who is portraying the
service and the purpose (King et al., 2013). Most scholars consider services as economic
activities offered by one party to another in exchange for money, time, and/or effort
(Kandampully et al., 2014; King et al., 2013). Managers play a key role in the service
hospitality industry (Arendt, Paez, & Strohbehn, 2013). Managers influence or establish
20
policies, standards, rewards, punishments, employee training, and provide the resources
needed to follow satisfactory service practices (Arendt et al., 2013).Retaining employees
in the hospitality industry can present a challenge for many business leaders without
effective strategies to retain skilled workers (Mohlala, Goldman, & Goosen,2012;
Vijayakumar, 2012).
Managing priorities in the service sector. The growing importance of the
service sector of the economy has stimulated interest in understanding how to design
hospitality organizations for optimal performance (Elliot, 2011). The nature of the service
sector is derived from an organizational leader’s need to coordinate work that increases
organizational proficiency and employee retention (Oreg & Berson, 2014). The potential
costs of replacing and retraining skilled workers to meet the demands of the growing
hospitality market drive the service sector (Oreg & Berson, 2014; Strom, Sears, & Kelly,
2014). As the hospitality service industry strives to survive under the present challenging
economic conditions, Vijayakumar (2012) suggested that employers foster atmospheres
that play close attention to the cost of doing business while implementing policies and
practices that address each employee’s needs. Ruizalba, Bermúdez-González, RodríguezMolina, and Blanca (2014) defined hospitality jobs as service delivery jobs, which
include jobs in hotels, resorts, restaurants, and other food services. Hospitality businesses
thrive when a definite connection arises from positive interactions between individual
employees and the guests (Ruizalba et al., 2014). The hospitality industry is comprised of
both production and service aspects (Darling, 2014). An organization’s goal is to exceed
the customer’s expectations during the interexchange of service (Darling, 2014).
21
A manager’s efforts to create a productive workplace could play a substantial role
in helping to achieve an organization's financial goals (Daniels, Mackovjak, Audia, &
Richards, 2013). Managers have the responsibility of working within the human
resources guidelines to ensure that retention strategies align with business goals. Human
resource (HR) planning is focused on attracting and retaining highly skilled staff, which
benefits hospitality organizations (Saad, 2013). Managers of services in any category,
whether retail, factory, or hospitality, share similar retention challenges with a highly
qualified workforce (Daniels et al., 2013). Managers of labor-intensive services should
concentrate on performance goals and personnel matters (Daniels et al., 2013). Saad
(2013) determined that organizational leaders who consider employees as a valuable asset
will manage human capital by using positive HR practices and managerial styles. From a
social change perspective, HR practices and managerial styles are valuable to
organization leaders because employees provide support for business operations in their
efforts to provide quality services and products. Managers who addressed the challenge
of unmanaged employee turnover moved organizations toward a reliable workforce
(Daniels et al., 2013). Saad (2013) concluded that a workplace filled with valuable
employees could add value through increased competitive advantage (Saad, 2013). Saad
found that competitive advantages can include environmental factors relevant to the
satisfaction or to the ability to retain a workforce might not be within the control of the
manager.
Environmental forces may serve as a reward for an acceptable level of
performance (Kim, 2014). The hospitality environment is a market where competitive 
22
demands force managers to find and retain frontline employees capable of delivering
quality customer services (Karatepe, 2013). Kim (2014) noted that excessive turnover in
the tourism and hospitality industry appears to cause dissatisfaction to thousands of
people intermittently; the impact is underrated in contemporary financial systems. The
longer employees stay with hospitality organizations, the more loyal they can become,
which may help an organization’s sustainability (Hofhuis, Van der Zee, & Otten, 2014).
Managers can inspire their employees to stay as long as they can in their organizations
(Andert, Platt, & Alexakis, 2011). Reducing the number of employees who leave an
organization is a top priority for leaders (Harris, Li, & Kirkman, 2014). Businesses across
the service industry spectrum reported employee retention as both problematic and costly
(Harris et al., 2014; Hofhuis et al.,2014). The reason an employee decides to leave an
organization varies (Harris et al. 2014). One researcher perceived factors include
competitive compensation packages, a deficiency of trust and openness, weak leadership,
and growth opportunities (El-Ramly, 2012). Leadership styles are integral to the retention
of employees (Harris et al., 2014; Hofhuis et al., 2014) and hospitality organizations need
retention strategies in place to ensure better the retention of employees within the
hospitality industry.
Employee Motivations
Managers have the responsibility to implement recruitment, compensation, and
performance management systems to attract, motivate, and retain the right people for
their organization (Smothers, 2011). The high costs of training new employees, combined
with a decline in service quality, add to hospitality managers’ concerns about employee
23
turnover and retention (Andert et al., 2011). Employee turnover and retention adversely
affect many aspects of managers’ work including costs, ensuring service quality, and
maintaining the productive morale of remaining employees (Chauhan, Goel, & Arora,
2014). An examination of what motivates individuals within organizations can enhance
understanding of how to retain employees (Andert et al., 2011).
Understanding an employee needs. Maslow (1943) stated that people have a
variety of driving forces that motivate them, and no two individuals have the same forces
driving them at a given time (Kessler, 2013). The driving forces stem from physiological,
safety, belonging, esteem, and self-actualization needs (Gouviea, Milfont, & Guerra,
2014). Maslow (1943) concluded that needs are satisfied in a hierarchy flow; once the
first level or lower order need is met, a person gradually moves to satisfying the next
need. For example, employees can meet their basic physiological needs, such as food and
shelter, before moving on to meet the need for safety (Maslow, 1943). The desire to
satisfy physiological needs increases as obligations outside of work grow (Gouviea et al.,
2014). Developing an understanding of what an employee needs can empower managers
to develop effective retention strategies (Gouviea et al., 2014). Managers that develop
employee retention strategies could meet the needs of employees and improve the odds of
retaining them (Gouviea et al., 2014).
Employee’s need for belonging to a group. Zameer, Ali, Nisar, and Amir (2014)
justified that the development of workplace groups supports an employee need to feel
they are a part of a group setting in an organization. Groups in the work environment
consist of employees who interact with one another (Fitzsimmons & Stamper, 2014). The 
24
interaction occurs in a manner in which the behavior or performance of the group
influence the behavior performance of the other members (Shevellar, Sherwin, &
Barringham, 2014). Managers who form workplace groups can use those groups to
motivate employees to work harder to reach an organizational goal (Fitzsimmons &
Stamper, 2014; Zameer et al., 2014). Employees are attracted to groups because of the
potential to satisfy needs (Shevellar et al., 2014; Zameer et al., 2014). The physical
proximity and attraction, and the appeal of being a part of the achievement of group goals
and activities could fill a need for some employees (Zameer et al., 2014). Workplace
stressors related to groups include actions, situations, and events in which particular
demands are placed on people (Shevellar et al., 2014; Zameer et al., 2014).
Employee growth needs. Alderfer’s (1969) ERG theory of motivation concerned
existence, relatedness, and growth elements that are similar to employees’ needs (de
Haan et al., 2014; Kessler, 2013). Maslow (1943) proposed that unfulfilled needs at one
level are critical, and people will not abandon a need until the need is adequately
satisfied. In addition to the satisfaction of Maslow’s need hierarchy through the
progression, ERG theory is a frustration-regression process that plays an adverse role in
motivating workers (Alderfer, 1969). If the employees continuously experience frustrated
attempts to satisfy growth needs, relatedness needs reemerge as a motivating force,
resulting in individuals redirecting efforts toward exploring new ways to satisfy lowerorder needs (Alderfer, 1969). People are motivated to engage in behaviors that satisfy one
of the three sets of needs (Alderfer, 1969). Alderfer provided an interesting suggestion
for managers concerning employees’ higher order needs. If employees’ higher-order 
25
needs, such as growth, are blocked by company policies or lack of sufficient resources,
changes are needed in the organization (de Haan et al., 2014). In this instance,
managers could redirect employees' efforts toward relatedness or existence needs (de
Haan et al., 2014; Kessler, 2013).
Addressing an employee’s need deficiencies. McConnell (2011) stated that
managers could suggest strategies that an organization can implement to address
employee need deficiencies. Organizational leaders have the capability to provide
employee satisfaction through work; satisfied employees become increasingly aware of
their work environment (McConnell, 2011). McConnell (2011) argued that attempting to
address deficiencies had a greater impact on initiating and directing behavior than
focusing on lower-level needs that may be closer to fulfillment. Alderfer (1969) agreed
that employees sought the feeling of security within their work environment through
factors such as belonging to the group. After a fulfillment of the need for security,
employees will seek esteem, the last stage of self-actualization (Alderfer, 1969). With
self-actualization, employees are motivated to do their best work, thereby also meeting
their psychological and physical needs (Gouviea et al., 2014; Kessler, 2013). An
employee who realizes a sense of belonging achieves fulfillment from the success of the
company (Kessler, 2013).
Managing expectations. Lunenburg (2011) stated that managers use Vroom's
(1964) expectancy theory of motivation to develop motivation strategies for employees.
Vroom’s theory is an explanation of the steps people take in pursuing and attaining an
outcome (Vroom, 1964). Additionally, Lunenburg (2011) noted that an employee might 
26
perform better due to anticipated consequences of actions. If a manager is going to use a
reward system to motivate employees, the perceived reward can be greater than the effort
exerted (Cartwright & Cooper, 2014). Managers can understand many aspects of
employees’ personality traits to determine what types of benefits motivate the required
work effort (Russ, 2011). Based on Vroom’s expectancy theory, employees have a
variety of expectations and managers must ensure that workers feel confident performing
to the organization’s standard (Russ, 2011). To elicit results and dedication from
employees, managers can understand and strive to meet individuals’ expectations
(Downes & Choi, 2014).
Maslow’s (1943) motivation theory, Alderfer’s (1969) ERG theory, and Vroom’s
(1964) expectancy theory clarified that motivations vary based on the environmental and
individual psychological needs. When employees have a high need for job security, the
need can result in a lower turnover rate (Alderfer, 1969). For this reason, organizational
managers who can recognize what motivates employees may reduce absenteeism and
turnover, which in turn positively affects overall productivity results (Bareket-Bojmel,
Hochman, & Ariely, 2014). Ultimately, managers could use the theoretical frameworks to
increase staff workplace retention, thereby improving individual, group, and
organizational effectiveness (Sebastian & Davison, 2011). When a manager understands
and addresses employee expectations and motives, managers position themselves to serve
their internal customers better, the employees (Kessler, 2013; Vroom, 1964). 
27
Leadership
From the creation of the first organized business, leadership has been a vital part
of the success and failure of an organization (Hargis, Watt, & Piotrowski, 2011). Graybill
(2014) found that, despite the importance of the concept of leadership, there is no clear
and consistent definition. Leadership, as defined by Dhawan and Zubin (2011), is the
ability to lead using various strategies to accomplish organizational goals collectively.
Larsson and Eid (2012) claimed that an effective leader can envision a solution for
problems while leading subordinates to follow designed strategies and run the
organization smoothly.
Leadership behavior. One of the fundamental signs of quality leaders is the
ability and skill to motivate followers to accomplish great things (Grant, 2012). Leaders
foster motivation by engaging in inspirational behaviors such as conveying a compelling
vision, emphasizing collective identities, expressing confidence and optimism, and
referencing core values and ideals (Grant, 2012). Per Grant (2012), leader behaviors
include accomplishing tasks and expending effort to maintain others who are completing
assigned tasks. Likert (1947) claimed that a manager's effectiveness is measurable by
productivity, job satisfaction, turnover, cost, and employee motivation. Measurements of
the effectiveness of leaders are behaviors and the ability to retain a satisfied workforce of
followers (Likert, 1947).
Certain qualities of leadership behavior are learned and adjusted through training
programs aimed at improving managers’ leadership skills; investments in leadership
development is considered safe (Wu, Tse, Fu, Kwan, & Liu, 2013). Managers behave as 
28
gatekeepers by increasing trust, empowering action, and respecting employees (Eversole,
Venneberg, & Crowder, 2012). Managers who engage themselves frequently in two-way
communication with employees can provide feedback that can motivate an employees’
work performance (Eversole et al., 2012). Specifically, acknowledging an employee’s life
outside work displays supportive behavior and helps to ensure tools and resources are
applied effectively to maintain a satisfied workforce of followers (Eversole et al., 2012).
Hon and Chan (2013) agreed that, finding that empowering behaviors are useful in
facilitating an employee’s self-concordance and creative efficacy when tasks are
interdependent. Lower than average employee turnover rates in an organization links to
an appreciation of the leadership styles that create the atmosphere of satisfied employees
(Hon & Chan, 2013).
The majority of researchers who have studied employee retention focused their
research efforts on employees being satisfied with their jobs with a particular focus on the
assignment of responsibilities in an effective and efficient way (Nunkoo, Gursoy, &
Rammkisson, 2013). Workers seek employment where they receive performance praises
(Nunkoo et al., 2013). Specifically, trust between an employee and a manager, and a
leadership style that encourages the development of skills among employees encourages
employee job satisfaction (McCole, Jacobs, Lindley, & McAvory, 2012). Certain types of
leadership styles have the potential to increase employee retention (McCole et al., 2012).
A significant influence on employee retention is the direction that employees receive
from their managers (Maier, 2011). Conversely, researchers know little about the specific
satisfaction levels of employees and preventive measures managers use to decrease the 
29
employee turnover rate (McCole et al., 2012).
Leadership styles. Leaders who demonstrate a particular leadership style create
the corporate cultures that influence organization performance (Choudhary, Akhtar, &
Zaheer, 2013). Leaders espouse different leadership styles due to a combination of group
values, competencies, skills, and personal styles. Liu, Cai, Li, Shi, and Yongqing (2013)
narrated that leadership styles affect employees’ self-perception within an organization.
Managers continuously work toward developing programs and encouraging behaviors
that can contribute to the professional abilities and advancement of employees (Sawa &
Swift, 2013). Managers can develop the leadership capability daily to reinforce the
mission and goals of the organization with employees (Sawa & Swift, 2013). Contract
and exchange relationships between a subordinate and a manager are built through the
leader-follower dyad (Liu et al., 2013). A high-quality leader-follower exchange allows
for mutual expectation and influence, which can reduce an employee’s intention to leave
(Liu et al., 2013). In general, Sawa and Swift (2013) determined that the leaders in a
company could play a substantial role in setting the tone and culture within an
organization. The dominant organizational leadership styles and preferences determine
the type of work, business practices, and opportunities accessible to employees (Sawa &
Swift, 2013). A manager's implementation of a leadership style could affect the overall
tone and attitude of the work environment and the method of executing the vision for the
business (Sawa & Swift, 2013).
Dinh et al. (2014) identified that various leadership styles, which include
authentic, autocratic, bureaucratic, charismatic, laissez-faire, servant, transactional, and 
30
transformational. When managers integrate any of the leadership practices, employees
may exhibit more satisfaction, improved efficiency, and deeper organizational
commitment (Dinh et al., 2014). When a manager uses one or more of the leadership
styles, it could have a positive effect on their organization (Farahani, Taghadosi, &
Behboudi, 2011).
Authentic style. Researchers have found that the leader with an authentic
leadership style has strong similarities with transformational, charismatic, and servant
style leaders (Murphy & Johnson, 2011; Wong & Laschinger, 2013). The use of an
authentic leadership model is increasing in legitimacy (Murphy & Johnson, 2011). Wong
and Laschinger (2013) noted that managers that emphasized transparency, balanced
processing, self-awareness, and high ethical standards increased employee job
satisfaction and performance. Leaders with a keen sense of behavior awareness are
authentic leaders (Murphy & Johnson, 2011). Authenticity includes applied ethics, strict
morals, and a high degree of awareness (Murphy & Johnson, 2011). Seeking the same
qualities in others, authentic managers help employees access opportunities to learn and
grow by providing necessary support and resources (Wong & Laschinger, 2013).
Specifically, authentic managers are more likely to create positive and empowering work
environments (Wong & Laschinger, 2013). Authentic leaders are intensely aware of their
environment, and demonstrate determination, poise, and optimism (Murphy & Johnson,
2011). Conversely, authentic leaders set their personal values and beliefs over another
individual, which cause potential biases and followers have a difficult time following
their leadership (Ford & Harding, 2011).
31
Autocratic style. A leader that takes total control and makes all of the decisions is
using an autocratic style (Stacher, 2011). Autocratic leadership styles are common in
military regimes and nondemocratic countries (Stacher, 2011). The autocratic leader
demonstrates a controlling attitude towards the team and makes decisions without
member input or agreement (Monzani, Ripoll, & Silla, 2014). Monzani et al. (2014)
argued that this type of leader provides strong task direction; however, an autocratic
leader is not concerned with the feelings, thoughts, or satisfaction of subordinates
(Schoel, Bluemke, Mueller, & Stahlberg, 2011). Autocratic leadership hallmarks include
control of the flow of information and maintaining a tight hold on communication and
authority (Schoel et al., 2011). Further, the autocratic leader will delegate very little to
subordinates (Monzani et al., 2014).
Bureaucratic style. The bureaucratic leadership style is comparable to the
autocratic leadership style (Green & Roberts, 2012). Green and Roberts (2012) argued
that bureaucratic leaders acquire authority through control and detail orientation. In a
bureaucratic administration, there is an assembly of leaders in power (Singh, 2013). The
autocratic leader, however, tends to focus on having power and influence over an
individual (Stacher, 2011). Elena (2012) found that leaders at government organizations
espouse a bureaucratic leadership style. A bureaucratic leader can sometimes demand
stringent compliance to a set of rigid rules and regulations as determined by the
governing body (Elena, 2012; Green & Roberts, 2012), making the style quickly
adaptable to fit a modern organization in a fixed work environment.
Bureaucratic leadership is management driven, where the current system and 
32
procedure maintenance are paramount to success (Elena, 2012). Bureaucratic leaders
eliminate creativity and do not welcome diverse ideas of others (Stacher, 2011). The
bureaucratic leader discourages the outside input to the point of alienating others
(Stacher, 2011). The bureaucratic leader secures power in the strict enforcement of detail
and accountability; leaders manage resources and delegate only particular assignments
(Stacher, 2011). The bureaucratic concept can be beneficial for organizations seeking to
emphasize regularity, reliability, and efficiency (Milosevic & Bass, 2014). Employees
welcome organizational leaders that create fixed division of tasks, hierarchical
supervision, and detailed rules and regulations with a high need for regularity and order
(Milosevic & Bass, 2014). Effective bureaucratic managers encourage routine, detail,
accountability, control layers, and rule through information control (Green & Roberts,
2012).
Charismatic style. Charismatic leaders view others as valuable assets to an
organization (Hayibor, Agle, Sears, Sonnenfeld, & Ward, 2011). Charismatic leaders
offer encouragement and demonstrate the ability to motivate followers (Dionne et al.,
2012). They have high emotional intelligence and know what to say to motivate
subordinates to achieve preferred results (Wilderom, Van den Berg, & Wiersma, 2012).
The charismatic leader possesses vision, enthusiasm, and confidence, with the ability to
infuse colleagues with these qualities (Dionne et al., 2012). Yammarino and Dansereau
(2011) described that charismatic leaders as being able to use their charisma to gain
power and influence, yet may take risks. A comparison of transformational, servant, and
spiritual leadership styles could enable researchers to contrast relative honesty, trust, and 
33
optimism behaviors (Yammarino & Dansereau, 2011). For example, Murphy and
Johnson (2011) found that charismatic leaders claim to be authentic but use the power
primarily to benefit themselves instead of subordinates.
Laissez-faire style. A laissez-faire leader allows subordinates to have total control
over their work tasks (Salman, Riaz, Saifullah, & Rashid, 2011). This style of leadership
exercises a relaxed approach to leading (Salman et al., 2011). The laissez-faire leaders
leave the decision-making process up to others and are absent from their leadership role
(Deriu, 2012; Westerlaken & Woods, 2013). Mehmood and Arif (2011) revealed that the
laissez-faire leader does not desire the role and the responsibility of being a leader. Raja
(2012) concluded that his relaxed approach does not display proper leadership
(Mahseredjian, Karkoulian, & Messarra, 2011).
Servant style. The servant leader demonstrates a helping behavior and ensures
that individuals accomplish professional and personal goals (Sun, 2013). A servant leader
desires to meet the needs of followers rather than lead them (Gillet, Cartwright, & Van
Vugt, 2011). Servant leadership differs from other styles of leading and is related to
transformational leadership (Sun, 2013). Hernandez, Everly, Avolio, and Johnson (2011)
noted that the servant leadership style extends beyond the transformational style because
the motives of a servant leader and subordinates link (Mittal & Dorfman, 2012). Hunter
et al. (2013) explained that servant leaders are capable of creating an organizational
service climate through role modeling and social exchange. Servant leaders focus on the
needs of followers through an interactive social exchange relationship, sharing leadership
responsibilities, and mutual influence (Rai & Prakash, 2014). Servant leaders prioritize
34
employees’ development and individual growth (Poksinska, Swartling, & Drotz, 2013;
Rai & Prakash, 2014). Servant leaders detach themselves from employees to explore new
opportunities, resolve problems, and formulate organizational goals (Rai & Prakash,
2014). Servant leaders are known for their often separation from employees to focus on
the overall vision and to provide employees necessary directives to meet a new vision
(Poksinska et al., 2013). Research conducted by Shekari and Nikooparvar (2011) noted
that some employees might not respond to this leadership style. Servant leaders who cater
to an employee’s need for extreme manners lessen the employee’s perception of them as
an authoritative figure (Shekari & Nikooparvar, 2011).
Transformational style. The transformational leader motivates individuals to
perform tasks in a manner that exceeds the status quo. This style of leadership has
received a great deal of attention in the literature (Farahani et al., 2011). In 1985, the
transformational style became the preferred leadership approach in the United States
(Darden, 2011). A transformational leader encourages employees to exceed expectations
(Chen, Hwang, & Liu, 2012) and promotes radical change (Ishikawa, 2012).
Credited for producing a highly effective change in organizations, transformational
leaders typically have a positive effect on employees (Raja, 2012; Yang, 2012).
Specifically, this leadership style is the preferred style when exceptional employee
performance the goal (Obiwuru, Okwu, Akpa, & Nwankwere, 2011). Transformational
leaders can increase employee satisfaction and fulfillment scores (Abeysekera &
Jayakody, 2011). Researchers found that employees working for transformational leaders
had increased commitment to their jobs and their employer (Den Hartog & Belschak, 
35
2012; Yang, 2012). Transformational leaders permeate work with meaning, stimulate
followers intellectually, and inspire others to work against self-interests (Abeysekera &
Jayakody, 2011). When faced with a challenging context, transformational leaders may
have an impact on employee retention (Raja, 2012). The use of open communication
allows transformational leaders to motivate employees through an ambitious vision, high
expectations, risk taking, and setting standards of performance (Abeysekera & Jayakody,
2011). Den et al. (2012) concluded that the relationship between transformational leaders
and their employees is stronger if the employees or followers are aware that they possess
all skills and knowledge to accomplish a task. Transformational leaders have the ability
to link job success and career satisfaction (Den et al., 2012). The transformational leader
is self-confident and has a strong value system, but Hernandez et al. (2011) noted that
transformational leaders might exhibit behaviors that are both untrustworthy and
inauthentic. The potential limitation of transformational leaders' authenticity necessitates
a distinction between transformational and charismatic leadership styles to identify
negative behaviors of each leadership style (Murphy & Johnson, 2011).
Transactional style. The transactional leader uses an exchange process by which
the follower receives a reward for performing a certain task or job (Braun, Peus,
Weisweiler, & Frey, 2013). Transactional leadership includes a reciprocal exchange in a
mutual trade process (Lambright & Quinn, 2011). Leaders who implemented this style
utilized reward and corrective action to control a subordinate’s behaviors (Groves &
LaRocca, 2011). The transactional leader focuses on doing things correctly versus doing
the correct thing (Yammarino & Dansereau, 2011). Researchers have determined that 
36
transactional leaders place too much emphasis on superficial processes rather than on
substantial matters within the organization (Groves & LaRocca, 2011; Yammarino &
Dansereau, 2011). Transactional leaders approach leadership through monitoring and
controlling methods where rationality and economic means are enticements (Zhu, Riggio,
Avolio, & Sosik, 2011).
Employee Retention Strategies
Managers that ensure employees feel valued and supported can retain employees
and serve as an organizational stabilizing influence during change (Shahid & Azhar,
2013). High turnover rates can be an indication of managers’ challenges in retaining
workers (Shahid & Azhar, 2013). Retention strategies have become an integral part of an
organization’s business strategy (Ghosh, Satyawadi, Joshi, & Shadman, 2012). By having
a better understanding of the reasons that employees leave or want to leave an
organization, effective retention strategies could reduce turnover (Cohen, 2013).
Managers increasingly work in an unpredictable economic environment (Shahid
& Azhar, 2013). Employee knowledge is one of the most important sources of
organizational competitive advantages (Schmitt, Borzillo, & Probst, 2011). Reitz,
Stewart, and Bruce (2011) explained that job market competition and the need for
employee job embeddedness, have risen because of the lack of adequate salary. A
perceived adequate salary does not ensure an employee will remain with an organization
(Reitz, 2014). Job market competition may be a critical factor in an employee's decision
to quit a current job (Reitz et al., 2011). In the hospitality industry, retention strategies are
critical because many of the employees’ job skills are transferable to competitive 
37
organizations (Strom et al., 2014).
Managers are not alone in their quests for efficient organizational performance. In
most cases, employees have a stake in the performance of the organization
(Kochanowski, 2011). When employees experience problems or observe opportunities
for improvement, they engage in an improvement-oriented voice, which results in
speaking up or exiting the group (McClean, Burris, & Detert, 2013). Organizational
performance depends on managers having more than a passing knowledge of the
determinants of employee performance (Schmitt et al., 2011). Routine assessments of
personal effectiveness through performance evaluation to determine who can receive
promotions, raises, and other group rewards are favorable approaches to retaining
employees (Kochanowski, 2011).
Organizational leaders must create an organizational environment that prompts
employees to commit to the company by implementing effective employee retention
strategies (Strom et al., 2014). In the phenomenon under study, I explored what strategies
hospitality managers need to improve employee retention. Following is a discussion of
eight literature subthemes that pertain to employee retention strategies, including (a)
creating an employee-centered environment, (b) equating job performance to job
outcomes, (c) developing a positive relationship exchange, (d) making the job more
satisfactory, (e) compensation, (f) coaching opportunities, and (g) developing retention
strategies.
Creating an employee centered work environment. Gilbreath (2012) noted that
managers have the greatest impact, control, and influence on the functionality of a 
38
workplace. Regardless of leadership style, managers have an impact on creating the
culture of an organization (Gilbreath, 2012). When organizational leaders modify the
organizational culture to suit the needs of employees, workers tend to remain with the
company longer (Eversole et al., 2012). Employee discontent is dangerous to ignore
because it may lead to a decreased chance of a manager retaining an employee (Eversole
et al., 2012). Managers are responsible for creating the environment and incentives that
motivate employees to achieve satisfactory results and realize the overall company goals
and objectives (Braun, Avital, & Martz, 2012). Creating an organizational culture
responsive to employees’ nonworking needs could help to attract and retain talented
workers across generations (Eversole et al., 2012). Managers seek to create a consistent
workplace through knowledge and skills (Gilbreath, 2012). In the absence of healthy
work environments, employees are prone to dysfunction and low productivity, which
hinder overall organizational effectiveness (O’Halloran, 2011).
Valuing employees. Employees are critical to a business’s success (Park & Levy,
2014). The hospitality industry is a labor intensive and customer focused service industry
(Park & Levy, 2014). Employee turnover rates negatively influence productivity and
decreases consumer satisfaction. Freedman and Kosová (2014) claimed that the cost of
losing a hospitality employee included the loss of productivity measures and the time
involved to learn the necessary skills to replace that employee.
Managers’ classification of what makes an employee valuable is the job specific
performance context the employee exhibits in the workplace (Gallardo-Gallardo, Dries,
& González-Cruz, 2013). Some organizational leaders have precise definitions of high 
39
performing employees that are influenced by industry or occupational fields (GallardoGallardo et al., 2013). Researchers have noted a manager could identify a valued
employee via the individual level of productivity (Karatepe, 2013). An employee’s value
can be measured in relation to a peer using job-related behaviors and performance
outcomes (Kooij et al., 2013; Renwick, Redman, & Maguire, 2013).
Knowledge management. Employees hold valuable, organizational specific
knowledge, according to Wang, Noe, and Wand (2014), including ideas, facts, expertise,
and judgments relevant to individual, team, and organizational performance. Wang et al.
(2014) determined that an employee’s knowledge could enhance their performance and
potentially result in higher levels of compensation. Chong and Besharati (2014) noted
that employee knowledge could leverage into a competitive advantage through
knowledge sharing. Knowledge sharing ensures an employee’s valuable knowledge is
transferred within a hospitality organization to equip workers to meet customer demands
(Chong & Besharati, 2014).
Chong and Besharatri (2014) asserted that employees’ rate of retention in the
hospitality industry is low due to two common causes, which are low satisfaction and the
quality of leadership. Hence, it is important for hospitality leaders to motivate employees
to share knowledge to keep knowledge within the company (Chong & Besharatri, 2014).
Encouraging a company culture, which includes sharing knowledge sharing standards,
could help mitigate the negative impact of employee departures (Chong & Besharatri,
2014).
Organizations may not remain competitive if they fail to attract and retain talented 
40
workers (Eversole et al., 2012). Organizational leaders who reported the use of retention
strategies found employees to be an esteemed source of competitive advantage (Schmitt
et al., 2011). Organizational leaders that can hire and retain the best workforce are
proactive in reducing the unmanaged employee turnover rate (Cohen, 2013).
Employee retention strategies can take into account a company's effort, cost, and
time (Cohen, 2013; Schmitt et al., 2011). Temporary costs for an experienced employee
can rise to double the annual salary of a permanent employee (Capelli & Keller, 2014).
Replacement costs are increasing in Florida where an aging workforce and sinking
birthrates mean reduced availability of qualified workers (Frey, Bayon, & Totzek, 2013).
Managers who experience low employee turnover contribute to business efficiency (Frey
et al., 2013). Organizations benefit when low performers quit (Wang, Yang, & Wang,
2012). Thus, in addressing issues of turnover, managers can focus on whether high or low
performers leave the organization more frequently (Wang et al., 2012). Low retention
rates can be just as unhealthy for an organization because of the potential to cause stifling
opportunities for internal promotions and prevent new people from joining the
organization (Wang et al., 2012). Based on this research, hospitality managers could
change the employee retention rate within their business organizations. In addition, using
information from a small sample of managers may provide evidence that some managers
are gaining an edge on employee retention, strengthening the need for further research to
promote employee strategies for success in hospitality organizations.
Human capital. Employees control the effort and commitment they apply toward
a company’s objectives (Brymer, Molloy, & Gilbert, 2013). In response to the retention 
41
challenge, leaders consider effective methods to put employees' skill levels and abilities
to productive use (Brymer et al., 2013; Shuck & Herd, 2012). Employee retention is vital
because organizational results depend on a solid base of human capital (Frey et al., 2013).
Researchers declare there is no perfect method for retaining employees (Boone et al.,
2013; Frey et al., 2013). To retain high performing employees, leaders can grant more
extrinsic and intrinsic rewards to higher performers (Gupta & Shaw, 2014). Boone et al.
(2013) asserted that a lack of self-confidence and low perception of rewards results in the
majority of employees choosing to exit the company, rather than voicing discontent. The
research on enhancing employee retention using extrinsic and intrinsic rewards and the
relative the impact of an employee’s confidence or self-esteem remains inconclusive
(Boone et al., 2013).
Equating job performance to job outcomes. Greater job performance could
equate to improved job outcomes (Ryu & Lee, 2013). Managerial performance is
measured based on the return on assets, return on equity, net growth rate, and return on
sales (Ho, 2011). Organizational performance is evaluated using efficiency and
effectiveness measures (Ho, 2011). Organizational leaders that focus solely on company
performances lead to some employees feeling undervalued (Ryu & Lee, 2013). When
employees are satisfied with their jobs, employers retain employees in higher numbers
(O’Halloran, 2011). It is a critical role of managers to increase organizational
performance by managing the turnover retention equilibrium (Ryu & Lee, 2013). Ryu
and Lee (2013) found evidence that leadership can affect employee performance and
retention. Job performance relationships and turnover management have important 
42
implications in a business context in the area of employee retention (Ryu & Lee, 2013).
Creating positive relationship exchanges in the workplace. Managers who
understand and are comfortable with quality professional relationships can design
effective and motivational retention strategies (Biron & Boon, 2012). In the social
context of the manager to employee exchange relationships, the nature of the exchange is
absent from the discussion of how performance may relate to turnover (Biron & Boon,
2012). Employees that are satisfied with the quality of their relationships with managers
also become satisfied with their overall job experience (Venkataramni, Labianca, &
Grosser, 2013).
Employee retention intentions vary based on aspects of the social exchange
context, namely manager-subordinate exchanges (MSX) (Biron & Boon, 2012). Biron
and Boon (2012) failed to demonstrate that a strong relationship between peer relations
and turnover in their literature review on employee turnover. In a quality MSX
relationship, the manager offers the employee rewards (Biron & Boon, 2012). For
example, the manager could provide desirable responsibilities, increased responsibility,
information sharing, career development opportunities, tangible rewards, and benefits in
exchange for a substantial commitment, loyalty, and trust (Biron & Boon, 2012).
Conversely, the absence of MSX is marked by a lack of respect and trust (Biron & Boon,
2012). Under these conditions, managers strictly can enforce duties while subordinates
demonstrate little enthusiasm for high performance (Li & Liao, 2014; Vidyarthi,
Erdogan, Anand, Liden, & Chaudhry, 2014). The undesirable behavior may suggest that
disengaged employees are withdrawing from adverse work conditions or deciding to 
43
leave (Li & Liao, 2014; Vidyarthi et al., 2014). Employees that recognize a manager's
interest in establishing a relationship may not feel indebted to the manager, but they may
appreciate the perceived support (Mignonac & Richebe, 2013).
Job satisfaction. Employees' satisfaction with their jobs is vital to the success of
any business (Karatepe, 2013). Walsh and Bartikowski (2013) noted that strong
employee satisfaction scores correlated with a lower intention to terminate employment.
Tews, Michel, and Stafford (2013) also found that an employee's job satisfaction may
increase employee retention. Further, employees that received continuous management
and co-worker support experienced a high level of attachment and satisfaction with their
jobs (Karatepe, 2013). Job satisfaction is one predictive of an employee’s turnover
intention (Regts & Molleman, 2013).
Compensation. The amount of compensation employees receive plays a
substantial role in retaining employees (Gupta & Shaw, 2014). For example, companies
that surveyed employees during exit interviews reported the top reason that employees
terminate current employment is to accept higher paying jobs with other organizations
(Bryant & Allen, 2013; Gupta & Shaw, 2014). Employers choosing to undercompensate
their employees run the risk of trained employees quitting to seek higher wages and
benefits at another organization (Bryant & Allen, 2013).
Coaching opportunities. Beattie et al. (2014) explained that managers must look
for opportunities to allow workers to challenge themselves in situations where their skills
and competencies can grow. Employee coaching has an empowerment benefit for the
involved workers (Bryant & Allen, 2013). Developmental opportunities presented to 
44
employees can be a combination of an individual employee development plan and
management coaching (Kandampully et al., 2014). Depending on the task that managers
provide to employees, it is helpful to both parties when employees develop the necessary
skills (Kandampully et al., 2014). Employee retention enhances via career development
opportunities and coaching (Kim, Egan, Kim, & Kim, 2013). Managers who take a
proactive interest in being knowledgeable about employee retention factors, or the
positive effects of coaching employees, boost retention metrics in their organizations
(Kim et al., 2013).
Developing retention strategies. Research has also shown that developing a
strategy is a means to focus organizational efforts on achieving the desired goal
(Pangarkar, 2011). Managers who have a set of effective retention strategies can make
more efficient use of time, energy, and resources (Kandampully et al., 2014; Ryu & Lee,
2013). An employee retention strategy is a description of how a manager plans to achieve
the improved employee retention results (Shahid & Azhar, 2013). The strategy process is
less precise than an action plan (Milman & Dickson, 2014). A manager's action plan
includes a written outline for who, what, when, and how to implement the proposed
action in the organization (Pangarkar, 2011; Ryu & Lee, 2013). Management strategies
can be the product of an organized and rigorous planning process (Park & Levy, 2014;
Ryu & Lee, 2013). Pangarkar (2011) noted that managers with strategies that helped
propel them to an industry pinnacle arrived at the winning strategy through trial, error,
and unanticipated success. As organizations’ leaders strive for a deeper understanding of
effective employee retention strategies, it is crucial to understanding the processes by 
45
which an effective strategy formed (Park & Levy, 2014).
As noted by Milman and Dickson (2014), learning the strategies that managers
use to retain employees is a more proactive approach than studying why an employee
terminates employment. Business community managers can develop strategies that
ensure the quality of the goods or services they produce will improve the
multidisciplinary workplace (Gershengorn, Kocher, & Factor, 2014). Organizations
benefit from shared sets of strategies (Milman & Dickson, 2014). Managers at different
career levels can be empowered to make proactive decisions without waiting to react to
shifting pressures arising from an ever-changing environment (Gershengorn et al., 2014).
For example, implementing a targeted strategy for employee retention in occupations
experiencing labor shortages demonstrates a managerial sensitivity to the organizational
need for stability and sustained profitability (Gershengorn et al., 2014). With this
background in mind, Kandampully et al. (2014) recommended that researchers seek to
understand how hospitality service managers have developed retention strategies over
time to retain employees. The strategies that emerge from this study may provide
managers a better understanding of techniques and strategies traditionally used in the
hospitality industry to retain employees.
The Need for Employee Retention Strategies
Losing the best worker could negatively affect business on a strategic level
(Cardy & Lengnick-Hall, 2011). Mitchell, Burch, and Lee (2014) focused on the past,
present, and the future across levels of employee retention practices and found there is
still a need to study retention strategies. Cardy and Lengnick-Hall (2011) found that 
46
employment relationships are voluntary, and employees consider the option of remaining
in the organization or leaving the job. A manager’s employee retention techniques can
influence an employee’s desire to stay with the organization for a longer period (Cardy &
Lengnick-Hall, 2011). Researchers noted that employee retention research focused on the
need for managers to create employee access to growing opportunities (Collins-Camargo,
Ellett, & Lester, 2012; Gounaris & Boukis, 2013). Organizational stakeholders have a
high regard for human capital (Gounaris & Boukis, 2013). For this reason, managers can
retain employees to provide a competitive advantage (Gounaris & Boukis, 2013).
Effective employee retention strategies can motivate employees to contribute effectively
and remain with the organization for the maximum time (Collins-Camargo et al., 2012).
Employee retention is a fundamental organizational success factor; deploying effective
employee retention strategies increases the chances of retaining long-term high
performing employees (Sandhya & Kumar, 2011).
Researchers have studied employee retention to understand what strategies are
being used in the workplace. However, some leaders of hospitality organizations still
need effective employee retention strategies (Crick & Spencer, 2011; Lub, Nije Bijvank,
Matthijs Bal, Blomme, & Schalk, 2012). Lub et al. (2012) noted that, despite the
availability of retention strategies within some hospitality organizations, employers still
lack strategies to retain employees with the organizations. Hospitality managers need to
develop and implement effective retention strategies that make employees feel valued
and motivated (Lub et al., 2012). Conversely, Tavitiyaman, Qiu Zhang, and Qu (2012)
found evidence that effective employee retention strategies and aligned organizational 
47
structure can explain positive hospitality organization performance. A manager’s ability
to understand and provide for employee needs could influence an employee to remain in
the organization (Bareket-Bojmel et al., 2014). Carraher (2011) concluded that
understanding how to retain employees is crucial to creating an environment that
motivates and stimulates employees to want to stay within an organization.
Transition
Section 1 of this proposal included an introduction to the problem under study,
namely to uncover experiences of some hospitality managers with retention strategies to
retain employees. Employee retention is a widely studied issue in many fields, especially
the hospitality industry. For that reason, researchers are giving more attention to studying
this phenomenon to help organizations recognize what strategies hospitality managers
need to improve employee retention.
In my review of the literature, I included information on leadership styles that are
more effective in motivating employees, building employees’ satisfaction, and creating a
healthy workplace (Caruthers, 2011). In addition, I provided three major theories
regarding employee motivation that have emerged. The conceptual theories are Maslow’s
(1943) motivation theory, Alderfer’s (1969) ERG theory, and Vroom’s (1964)
expectancy theory. Managers need to understand the different dimensions of employee
motivation, such as personal growth, relationships, professional growth, and
compensation, addressed by these theories.
In Section 2, I elaborated on the processes and procedures for the qualitative
multiple case study research design used for this study. I described the research methods 
48
that I used to explore experiences of some hospitality managers with employee retention
strategies for reducing turnover. 
49
Section 2: The Project
In Section 1, the focus of the literature review was on the managerial
characteristics that promote employee retention. In Section 2, I presented the research
portion of the project, the restatement of the purpose of the study, and descriptions of
how I conducted the study. In this section, I also described the role of the researcher,
research methods, research question, study population, data collection, data analysis, and
reliability and validity.
Purpose Statement
The purpose of this qualitative multiple case study was to explore the strategies
hospitality managers need to improve employee retention. The population consisted of
experienced hospitality managers in Brevard County, Florida, who implemented
strategies to improve employee retention. Three experienced hospitality managers with
supervision and hiring responsibilities from mid-sized hospitality organizations
participated. Hospitality managers were appropriate for this study because these
managers were most suited to identify the strategies hospitality managers need to
improve employee retention with the consideration of real-life experiences. I also
collected and analyzed documents and I used a reflective journal to methodologically
triangulate the data. The implications for positive social change included possible
changes to impact business practices by providing hospitality managers strategies needed
for improving employee retention, thus improving the stability of and customers’
experiences with their organizations (Malik & Usman, 2011).
50
Role of the Researcher
Morse, Lowery, and Steury (2014) recommended that researchers collect the
perceived and lived descriptions of the people in a phenomenon and explain singularities
that can be lead to improvement in many fields of study. In a qualitative study, the
researcher is one of the data collection instruments (Eide & Showalter, 2012; Morse et
al., 2014). In this study, I served as the primary data collecter. The role of the researcher
in qualitative studies is to gather information accurately, report all data collected, and
identify shared lived experiences regarding the phenomenon (Eide & Showalter, 2012). I
collected data in a trustworthy manner by adhering to the protocols set forth in the
Belmont Report (Davis, 2013; Thomas, 2015) to mitigate the bias I had on the
phenomenon under study. I treated study participants in an ethical manner by respecting
their lived perceptions and by making efforts to secure their well-being (Eide &
Showalter, 2012). As the researcher, I protected and ensured the rights of human
participants are summarized in the Belmont Report (U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services [HHS], 1979). After receiving approval to conduct the study from the
Walden University’s Institutional Review Board (IRB), all study participants received
and signed a participant consent form prior to each interview (see Appendix A).
According to the Belmont Report, research participants received respect, time,
and the opportunity to decide whether to participate in the study (HHS, 1979).
Participation in my study was voluntary, and I provided prospective participants the
information they needed to determine whether they desired to enter into the research
study (see Appendix A). I treated each person in an ethical manner. As required by 
51
human subjects protocols identified in the Belmont Report (HHS, 1979), I respected each
person's decision regarding participation in the study and protected them from harm by
protecting their identifiable information. I am the only person with access to identifiable
information from the participants such as their names and organization information. I
gained and maintained the trust of the participants by keeping all of their identifiable
information secure, to maximize their benefits of participating in the study and minimize
potential perceptions of harm by the participants.
I was familiar with the topic of this study because I was once a management
executive in the retail industry with experience in retaining employees. To mitigate bias, I
identified my bias through the use of epoché. Moustakas (1994) recommended that the
qualitative researcher use epoché by documenting and describing his or her experiences
regarding the phenomenon before studying the phenomenon to study the phenomenon
from a fresh perspective. Epoché, or bracketing, is a technique used by researchers to
describe their experiences within or about the phenomenon before data collection to
mitigate bias (Moustakas, 1994). Following Moustakas' (1994) recommendations, I
acknowledged underlying perceptions of my research topic to mitigate bias in data
through the use of bracketing. Moustakas (1994) idea of implementating a mitigating bias
technique increased my alertness of my feelings about the phenomenon under study. I
conducted the doctoral research in the county where I lived. I had no professional or
personal relationship with any of the hospitality organizations or managers that
participated in my study. As I identified and bracketed my personal viewpoints sought to
better understand the viewpoints of others under study in the phenomenon (Marshall & 
52
Rossman, 2011).
Maslow’s (1943) motivation theory (1943), Alderfer’s (1969) ERG theory, and
Vroom’s (1964) expectancy theory served as the lenses I used to analyze interviews and
company employee-retention documentation data. I applied the components of these
theories to my research data to understand what employee retention strategies that some
managers are using to improve employee retention from an employee motivation
perspective. I used the interview questions to document each participant’s experiences
with addressing potential declines in motivation and changes in the workplace needs to
overcome employee retention obstacles through specific strategies.
Applebaum (2012) noted that qualitative interview questions encourage
respondents to provide detailed answers. Following the recommendations by Kisely and
Kendall (2011) on interview protocols, I established an interview protocol to ensure that I
treated each participant the same, thus helping to mitigate bias. Interview questions for
this study were open-ended, which I designed to prompt the participants to provide
richer, in-depth descriptions that answered the central research question through
semistructured interviews (Englander, 2012; Rice et al., 2014). The interview protocol
consisted of the following six steps: (a) an opening statement; (b) semistructured
interview questioning; (c) probing questions; (d) participants verifying themes noted
during the interview; (e) corrections to themes noted by the participants; and (f) a
recording of reflexive notes (Hudson et al., 2014; Kisely & Kendall, 2011; see Appendix
D).
53
Participants
I strictly followed Walden University's Institutional Review Board's (IRB)
guidelines as well as research protocols identified in the Belmont Report in recruiting
study participants. I selected each participant by using the same study participation
criteria for selecting all participants. I gave each potential participant an informed consent
letter for the study, which included an explanation of the trusted nature of the study, and
required each participant to sign an informed consent form prior to each interview (see
Appendix A).
Study participants worked as hospitality managers in Brevard County, Florida,
had at a minimum 5 years of managerial experience, and were at least 18 years of age.
The participants in the study were solicited to participate in a voluntary interview. The
process of purposefully selecting participants by researchers is necessary in order to
target a population that meets certain established criteria to gain a sample of participants
in the phenomenon (Davis, 2013, Kolb, 2012; Suri, 2011). Rowley (2012) claimed that
selecting a population and using more than 10 participants does not guarantee sufficient
data needed for a case study. I selected members of my study population based on the
criteria that I established for defining that population. Yin (2014) theorized that
researchers can compare two or three cases in a phenomenon to examine if there are
common experiences among the cases. I interviewed members of the target population
and analyzed the company documents pertaining to employee retention until I reached
data saturation. Guest, Bunce, and Johnson (2006) defined data saturation as the point in
data collection and analysis when data from new interviews produces little or no change 
54
to the already noted themes or codes.
After I received approval from the Walden University IRB (approval number 07-
27-15-0449573), I proceeded to identify and recruit eligible study participants. In order to
gain access to and establish a working relationship with the participants in the study, I
began recruiting in Brevard County through personal contacts and a recruitment letter
(see Appendix B) to identify eligible hospitality managers. Tirgari (2012) recommended
that when a researcher interviews one participant, he or she should ask the participant if
they can recommend other candidates they feel would be willing to participate. Baltar and
Brunet (2012) and Handcock and Gile (2011), referred to this method as snowball
sampling. I was prepared to use snowball sampling to identify other eligible study
participants if the data did not reach saturation. However, through the use of personal
contacts and purposive sampling similar to that used by Davis (2013), I successfully
solicited three study participants who provided the real-life context I needed to answer
the research question. To understand the real-life experiences of those currently in
hospitality management positions, I utilized a qualitative mutliple case study approach.
Research Method
There are three choices of research methods: quantitative, qualitative, and mixed
methods (Ostlund, Kidd, Wengstrom, & Rowa-Dewar, 2011). This study involved
investigating a phenomenon and presenting data from multiple sources of evidence such
as semistructured interviews and a review of documentation which is why I chose a
qualative research method. Exploring the different aspects of individual perspectives
helps determine how individuals interact with their environment (Ostlund et al., 2011). 
55
The research method for this study was qualitative to gain an understanding of retention
strategies of hospitality managers with the consideration of real-life experiences (Yin,
2014) and strategies used to improve employee retention.
A qualitative research method was the most valuable research method for this
study to explore the in-depth experiences of the participants (Davis, 2013; Moustakas,
1994). Utilizing qualitative methods enabled me to explore the experiences of hospitality
managers using interviews and company documents pertaining to employee retention to
understand the phenomenon of employee retention strategies in the hospitality industry.
Qualitative methods permit researchers to ask questions of the participants who have
experiences pertaining to what, where, and how the phenomenon under study affects
them (Barratt et al., 2011).
Quantitative research involves the use of testing and verifying or rejecting a
hypothesis (Vasquez, 2014). Conversely, a qualitative research method permits the
understanding of experiences of a particular phenomenon within a real-world context
(Borrego, Dougals, & Amelink, 2011; Echambadi, Campbell, & Agarwal, 2012; Yin,
2014). A quantitative approach was not an ideal study for exploring perspectives related
to strategies for retaining employees (Kamil, Mosenthal, Pearson, & Barr, 2014;
Vasquez, 2014). Quantitative methods require the use of numerical data and statistical
analysis to examine correlations between two variables, the independent and the
dependent (Barratt et al., 2011). Examining correlations between variables was not the
purpose of this proposed research. The use of a quantitative method quantifies the results
and highlights problems based on the data provided (Frels & Onwuegbuzie, 2013). The 
56
use of a quantitative method cannot provide the researcher an understanding of the
descriptive articulation of personal experiences (Frels & Onwuegbuzie, 2013). A
quantitative method was not well suited for addressing my research question.
Mixed methods research focuses on the exploration of problems and solutions
instead of understanding the cause of problems (Sparkes, 2014). Mixed methods include
a quantitative and a qualitative component (Bansal & Corely, 2012). The purpose of this
qualitative multiple case study was to explore the strategies hospitality managers need to
improve employee retention. Mixed method designs consist of the researcher using a
combination of deductive and inductive methods when one method is not sufficient
(Bansal & Corely, 2012). The objective of this study was not to test a theory or
hypothesis, but to compile hospitality managers’ strategies used to retain employees in
the hospitality industry (Borrego et al., 2011). A mixed method that includes a
quantitative component was not necessary to answer my research question.
Research Design
I explored four qualitative designs to determine which design provided the best fit
: (a) narrative, (b) ethnography, (c) phenomenological study, and (d) case study. I
selected a case study for the study’s research design. A case study research design allows
the researcher to explore and conduct a comprehensive analysis of an experience in order
to gain a full understanding of the real-world context (Reiter, Stewart, & Bruce, 2011;
Yin, 2014). The purpose of this study was to explore each study respondent’s real-life
experiences, analyze documents, and search for themes consistent with the research
literature, and investigate the phenomenon (Yin, 2014). Given the importance of 
57
exploring strategies for hospitality managers to use in order to improve employee
retention, I conducted a multiple case study. By including multiple cases, I hoped to add
complexity and richness to the literature and discover what was unique about the
retention strategies of hospitality managers with the consideration of real-life experiences
(Stake, 1995) used to implement employee retention strategies.
A case study design was the most applicable to this study. Conducting case study
research allows the researcher to conduct exploratory research to ask how or what
questions (Gioia et al., 2012; Yin, 2014). Case study research allowed me to comprehend
the characteristics of the real-life events that some hospitality managers experience
(Gioia et al., 2012; Yin, 2014). The use of a case study design enabled me to conduct an
investigation to get close to several individuals and their interactions on a day-to-day
practice (Moll, 2012). Stake (1995) noted researchers who used multiple cases had an
opportunity to bridge the findings from a single case experience together with similar
individuals in the phenomenon to derive an answer to the research question. I selected a
multiple case study design for the study. Additionally, Yin (2014) stated that researchers
who used case studies used multiple sources of evidence from multiple organizations to
collect the data needed to gain an understanding of the experience in a real-life context. I
used open-ended questions presented through semistructured face to face interviews and
company documents related employee retention strategies for data collection to document
managers' experiences with employee retention strategies. I used a case study research
design to gain insight into the circumstantial conditions and collect multiple sources of
data from participants in the phenomenon (Yin, 2014). 
58
A multiple case study is an appropriate design if participants are representatives
of the same group in the phenomenon under study (Yin, 2014). I examined a small
population of hospitality managers in similar settings to explore, describe, and explain a
phenomenon in a real-life context (Yin, 2014). I used multiple types of data including
interviews and company documents pertaining to employee retention strategies
approaches to gather data (Gioia et al., 2012; Petty, Thomson, & Stew, 2012; Yin, 2014).
Similar to Gibbons (2015), I reviewed prior research findings to eliminate research
designs for use in my study based on how researchers used each design in practice.
Researchers who use narrative inquiry to explore a phenomenon use data
collection techniques that include field notes, letters, stories, autobiographies, journals,
photographs, discussions, consultations, family stories, and life experiences as
information sources (Banister, Bunn, Burman, & Daniels, 2011; Elliot, 2011). Elliot
(2011) and Wells (2011) noted that a researcher using narrative inquiries collects stories,
group conversations, and documents as the primary source of data. A narrative design
was unsuitable for the proposed study because narrative researchers explore small lifelong stories to capture the essence of the phenomenon (Kar & Samantarai, 2011). In this
study, I was not seeking to document and use stories from participants to retell stories in
unique ways.
Observations in ethnographic research can result in an overview of a phenomenon
that is being studied (Lambert, Glacken, & McCarron, 2013). Ethnographic inquiry
methods are appropriate to determine cultural characteristics, such as class, race, and
gender of the whole group (Lambert et al., 2013). A researcher who uses ethnographic 
59
inquiry attempts to absorb himself or herself into the day to day activities of the study
group for an extended period (Ronald, 2011). This study did not determine cultural
characteristics, such as class, race, and gender of the whole organization. I did document
the lived experiences of hospitality managers related to employee retention strategies.
A phenomenological design requires the researcher use at least 20 participants
and a great deal of time immersed in the study from the inception up to the point of data
analysis (Bevan, 2014). The use of a phenomenological design does not include the use
of the secondary documentation to implement methodological triangulation (Denzin &
Lincoln, 2011; Roberston & Thompson, 2014; Yin, 2014). I considered the use of a
phenomenological design to explore the experiences of managers from their perspectives
and to uncover and analyze themes that could have developed from the use of
interviewing participants (Bradbury-Jones, Taylor, & Herber, 2014). A phenomenology
design was not the most appropriate method to explore a particular and complex
phenomenon within its real-world context, which was the intent of my study (Yin, 2014).
When a researcher is conducting exploratory research, studying the phenomenon in a
natural setting, or determining what happened or why it happened, Yin (2014) suggested
that a case study research design is most suitable.
Qualitative researchers analyze their data throughout their study, unlike
quantitative researchers (Morse et al., 2014). Rowley (2012) stated that case study
research requires a sample size between one and 10 participants. A sample population of
larger than 10 participants does not guarantee richness in data (Rowley, 2012). Interviews
in qualitative studies are conducted with study participants until the data reaches 
60
saturation (Carlsen & Glenton, 2011). Data saturation is the point in data collection and
data analysis when information from data produce little or no change to the already noted
themes or codes (Davis, 2013; Guest et al., 2006; Kolb, 2012). Yin (2014) stated that a
population sample size of two or three case studies could be enough to explore a
phenomenon if the researcher’s applied theory is straightforward, and the degree of
certainty is not extreme. Guest et al. (2006) determined that data saturation can occur
within the first six interviews conducted in a study. To ensure there were sufficient data
to analyze, I interviewed the target population and analyzed the company employee
retention documents until the data reached saturation. I coded and analyzed all of the data
in my study including my reflexive journal, the interviews, and company documents
pertaining to employee retention strategies. The use of face-to-face semistructured
interviews and other data collection methods did not allow me to gather data about the
real-life experiences of some managers in the hospitality industry relating to employee
retention strategies. Thus, prior research supported my use of a small sample size of
participants for this study.
Population and Sampling
The population for the study consisted of three hospitality managers from midsized hospitality organizations in Brevard County, Florida. Yin (2014) noted that
researchers use an exploratory multiple case study if participants are representatives of
the same group. I used a purposive selection strategy to select members of my study
population that have experience in the development of retention strategies (Davis, 2013).
I contacted potential participants through personal contacts, a recruitment letter (see 
61
Appendix B), and a list of hospitality organizations in Brevard County, Florida. I
anticipated recruiting additional participants through snowball sampling. Tirgari (2012)
described that snowball sampling as asking a study participant to suggest someone else
who might be willing or appropriate for the study. I did not use snowball sampling
techniques because purposeful sampling allowed me to intentionally sample a group of
people who have real-life experiences about the problem under investigation (Walker,
2012).Purposive sampling methods are advantageous when conducting case study
research (MacBeth et al., 2014). Researchers who use purposive sampling create a
descriptive analysis of the phenomenon (MacBeth et al., 2014; Xie, Wu, Luo, & Hu,
2012).
Borrego et al. (2011) defended the use of a population and selection criteria in a
study to guarantee the selection of study participants that represent the research
phenomenon. Researchers have reported the population size should be large enough to
bring credibility to the study, yet small enough to allow for adequate depth, detail, and
richness of the case (Rowley, 2012). A population size of two to three cases is
recommended by Yin (2014) when conducting multiple case studies, and two to three
cases are sufficient as a prediction of literal replication of real-life experiences within the
context of the phenomenon. Researchers conducting multiple case studies with a
population size of two or three may obtain rich data using interviews and secondary data
to achieve an understanding of the phenomenon (Carlsen & Glenton, 2011; Rowley,
2012; Yin, 2014). A small number of participants in a case study is enough (Rowley,
2012) if the theory is straightforward (Yin, 2014). I limited participants in the study to a 
62
specific geographic location and a particular type of organization to find participant
representatives within the same geographical setting (Yin, 2014). The population and
geographic area selected were suitable for the proposed multiple case study the strategies
that hospitality managers in Brevard County, Florida need to improve employee retention
in hospitality organizations in a state with similar economic and growth challenges as
well as other states in the southeastern United States.
Participants in the study worked as a manager in hospitality organizations located
in Brevard County, Florida, had a minimum of 5 years of experience in management, a
minimum of a bachelor’s degree, experience implementing retention strategies, and were
at least 18 years of age. These characteristics helped me narrow the population of study
participants to experienced managers who varied in their perceptions and lived
experiences with employee retention issues. As recommended by Yin (2014) for case
studies, I collected secondary data in the form of documentation that aided in identifying
strategies to promote employee retention. I interviewed participants until I determined
that the data reached saturation. I knew when the data reached saturation in my study
when no new information or no new themes emerged, and there was sufficient
information to replicate the study (Guest et al., 2006).
Gathering sufficient amounts of data was critical to support the credibility,
transferability, dependability, and confirmability of the study (Rennie, 2012). The data
reached saturation when the participants offered no new information after verifying notes
from other participants previously interviewed (Kolb, 2012). Reaching saturation in the
data was required and was my goal in exploring the experiences of hospitality managers 
63
and their retention strategies. To ensure there were sufficient data to analyze, I
interviewed the targeted population and analyzed company documents about employee
retention until the data reached saturation (Guest et al., 2006). Overall, Yin (2014)
justified the use of a small population size of participants when conducting multiple case
studies.
When I identified a potential study participant, I made an appointment for a time
to meet in-person to review the study protocol, participants' rights, and I conducted the
interview after the manager consented to participate (Davis, 2013). As recommended by
Davis (2013) and Tigari (2012) for study settings, I asked each participant to meet in a
mutually agreed upon private location outside of the manager’s work site to gather as
much detail about their employee retention strategies as possible. The interview location
took place in a private and quiet setting that was convenient for each study participant.
After conducting and transcribing the participant’s interview, I asked each participant to
conduct member checking.
Member checking is a process of the researcher restating, summarizing, or
paraphrasing the information received from a study participant to ensure their comments
have been interpreted accurately (Stake, 1995). I conducted member checking to allow
participants to verify the accuracy of my interpretations of their real-life experiences
(Harper & Cole, 2012). The process I followed was restating or summarizing the
participants’ views, feelings, and experiences, and asking them to either affirm or correct
my interpretations (Harper & Cole, 2012). After data collection, member checking
involved providing the preliminary findings to the participants, asking for critical 
64
feedback on the findings, and incorporating these critiques into the findings (Lincoln &
Guba, 1985; Stake, 1995). Subsequently, I transcribed and proofread each participant's
interview responses and provided each participant a copy of the interview questions and
my summary of their interview responses, then asked each participant to verify if I had
accurately summarized their intended responses (Harper & Cole, 2012; Stake, 1995). At
that time, the participant had the opportunity to affirm or correct the accuracy and
completeness of my synthesis of their interview responses (Harper & Cole, 2012).
Following each interview, study participants received a thank you for their participation
in the study in addition to a final copy of the study’s findings via e-mail or mail.
Ethical Research
The researcher has the sole responsibility to protect participants and strengthen
the validity of the research results (Eide & Showalter, 2012). In this study, to comply
with the Belmont Report ethical guidelines, I protected the rights and confidentiality of
research participants (HHS, 1979). The informed consent letter (see Appendix A)
outlines the precautionary measures that I followed when conducting my research. Each
hospitality manager voluntarily consented to participate in the study. I did not harm the
participants, and I minimized risks by protecting the participants’ identification and their
respective organizations (HHS, 1979). I selected each participant fairly by using the same
study participation criteria for selecting each participant (HHS, 1979). Carenza (2011)
and Sherrod (2011) justified the inclusion of precautionary measures to protect the
identity of participants. The measures that I followed were: (a) assigning identification
markings to identify participants instead of participant names, (b) assigning identification 
65
markings to label all participant data, and (c) assigning identification markings to
reference the participants in the research results. Xie et al. (2012) concluded that
incorporating precautionary measures could lessen the potential harm to respondents. I
implemented ethical assurances by explaining rights of study participants and obtaining
informed consent from each participant, protecting the participants’ rights to privacy,
ensuring confidentiality, and maintaining honesty in collaborating with other professional
colleagues (HHS, 1979; Xie et al., 2012). I obtained consent to use and reproduce
employee retention documents from each hospitality company’s official with the
authority to release those documents. The consent and document release form (see
Appendix E) outlines the measures I followed to protect the information in those
documents, which were confidential and not disclosed. Participants in the study were not
offered any incentive for their participation in the study to avoid coercion. Compensation
was not offered to all the participants to avoid influence based on the financial gain (Fein
& Kulik, 2011).
To protect participants’ identities and job descriptions, I was the only person with
information on participants’ identification details and access to their personal data. I
protected the names of the participants and the organizations they represented at all times.
I assigned identification numbers to participants in the form of P1 – P3 to distinguish the
interview responses for the purpose of transcribing and coding the data. If a participant
wished to withdraw at any point during the study, even after the conclusion of data
collection, I honored their request. Participants were permitted to withdraw at any time
without penalty or notification. The participants were allowed to contact me by phone or 
66
e-mail to ask to withdraw, and I withdrew them with no further explanation. Once I
received a participant’s request to withdraw, I contacted them to confirm their request
and inform them that I removed all of their information from the study. I removed all of a
participant's information from my files by shredding printed information and erasing
electronically stored information. In addition to a copy of the consent form, each study
participant received copies of the information about the data storage and disposal process
before the start of each interview. The data storage and disposal process entailed storing
electronic data on a computer hard drive on a computer that is password protected. I had
sole access to the electronic files. I locked all secondary data documents, which included
my reflective journal and company documentation, in a safe that only I can access. After
5 years, I will destroy the data by shredding copies of printed information and
electronically erasing all study files on the computer.
Data Collection Instruments
Data collection in qualitative research can involve direct interactions with an
individual or interaction in a group setting (Petty et al., 2012). As the researcher in a
qualitative study, I was the data collection instrument. Carenza (2011) noted that the
researcher is the instrument for data collection and analysis across all phases of a
qualitative research project. This role increases the unavoidability of a transmission of
interest, values, and emotions when collecting data (Anyan, 2013; Harnish, 2013).
I was interested in adding to the body of knowledge on strategies that hospitality
managers need to improve employee retention. To mitigate bias, I only interviewed
managers with whom I had no professional or personal relationship with the phenomenon 
67
under examination. Additionally, I implemented a reflexive journaling process to bracket
my experiences regarding the phenomenon under examination.
Lincoln and Guba (1985) recommended that implementing a journaling process to
ensure mitigation of personal bias, morals, or beliefs when conducting qualitative
research. Researchers have found that a total detachment of a researcher’s personal
perceptions is unattainable (Lincoln & Guba, 1985; Yu, 2014). In qualitative research, the
researcher is an integral component of the entire research process. However, researchers
can mitigate biases using a reflexive journal (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). As the researcher,
my viewpoint and assumptions can inevitably influence the context of the participants’
experiences under investigation. Ponterotto (2014) and Fields and Kafri (2009) concluded
that the use of reflexive journals could increase a researcher’s ability to maintain a
reflexive stance toward the phenomenon under study. A reflexive journal was another
form of bracketing (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). I used a research reflexive journal to include
bracketing from the beginning of this research process when I first conceptualized the
idea to explore the phenomenon and continued throughout the research.
Some of the primary sources for collecting qualitative data are focus groups,
observations, individual interviews, and documentation (Petty et al., 2012). Qualitative
researchers aim to explore and understand participants’ experiences (Tembo, Parker, &
Higgins, 2013) in-depth and to associate meanings across populations. I used in-depth,
semistructured interviews as the process to collect primary data in this study. Ocak
(2011) determined that interviews are a useful approach for collecting data from
participants regarding a phenomenon. Lincoln and Guba (1985) noted that prolonged 
68
engagements are investments of sufficient time to achieve learning the perceptions of the
phenomenon and building the trust of the participants. It is imperative for researchers to
be involved long enough in a study to detect and take into account biases that might
otherwise affect the interpretation of the data (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). For this reason, I
utilized semistructured interview questions supported by my literature review to gather
hospitality managers’ experiences with implementing employee retention strategies.
Interviews are forms of prolonged engagement that I used to become oriented to
the phenomenon, which Lincoln and Guba (1985) suggested as one of the strategies that
will increase the credibility of a study. I used semistructured interview questions to probe
participants’ experiences as I observed, documented, and described the participants’
responses to ensure credibility, transferability, dependability, and confirmability.
Interview questions are available in Appendix C. I did not conduct a pilot test of the
interview questions. Gibbons (2015) allowed the participants in his study to clarify
questions during the interview process, and I afforded my study participants the same
opportunity. In addition to in-depth interviews, I expanded data collected from the
interviews with other secondary data. I asked each participant for company documents
and records pertaining to employee retention strategies, which was similar to the method
used by Gibbons (2015) and Thomas (2015), so that I had secondary data that were useful
in understanding what employee retention strategies are used to improve employee I
conducted member checking. Member checking took place after I coded and analyzed
each interview and company documents pertaining to employee retention strategies. I
paraphrased the information received from the participant responses to the interview 
69
questions and the company documents pertaining to employee retention, and then I asked
each participant to verify that I had accurately interpreted these (Lincoln & Guba, 1985;
Stake, 1995). Asking the participants to review a summary of my interpretation of their
responses to the interview questions and company documents pertaining to employee
retention strategies can increase the trustworthiness of the finalized analyzes and
conclusions (Lincoln & Guba, 1985).
Hudson et al. (2014) recommended that researchers conduct member checking to
verify the accuracy of the information obtained from study participants. Another aspect
of member checking is a participant verification process (Harper & Cole, 2012) done by
asking the participant to check the researcher's interpretations of their comments and
analysis of the company documents pertaining to employee retention strategies. Member
checking follows the data collection process and consists of reporting back preliminary
findings to participants, asking for critical feedback on the findings, and incorporating
any critique into the findings (Goldblatt, Karnieli-Miller, and Neumann, 2011). I
contacted participants to verify my summary and interpretations of their interview
responses and summarized company documentation pertaining to employee retention
strategies during data analysis and data coding to testing the emerging interpretations and
conclusions (Stake, 1995). The summary of the participant responses and company
documents pertaining to employee retention strategies consisted of a description of the
key themes that emerged from the participant responses to the interview questions and
the company documentation pertaining to employee retention strategies. By providing the
participants the opportunity to check for any misinterpretation of their responses ensured
70
that I captured their intended views.
Data Collection Technique
Ponterotto (2014) noted that a researcher should try to put aside his or her
perceptions to focus on the phenomenon. It is impossible for a researcher to remove all
personal biases (Fields & Kafi, 2009; Ponterotto, 2014), a researcher can mitigate the
potential adverse effects of unacknowledged preconceptions related to the research
(Fields & Kafi, 2009; Ponterotto, 2014). When a researcher facilitates epoché, they can
increase the rigor of their academic research project (Kamil et al., 2014; Yu, 2014).
Researchers found that too much time on an emotionally challenging topic could result in
inherent challenges and skew the results and interpretations (Pfaff, Baxter, Jacks, &
Ploeg, 2014; Ponterottos, 2014). As recommended for researchers by Lincoln and Guba
(1985), I developed a reflexive journal that includes reasons for undertaking the research.
Moustakas (1994) recommended that researchers start the journaling process by
using the technique of bracketing to identify biases and beliefs. A researcher uses
bracketing so that he or she may be aware of any potential biases that they need to set
aside to view the phenomenon under study from a fresh perspective (Moustakas, 1994).
During the research process, I used a journal to express personal assumptions and clarify
individual belief systems to identify, manage, determine, and mitigate any potential bias
that could affect the study results. I had no personal or professional connection with the
participants and organizations that I included in this study. I mitigated bias while
studying the phenomenon by not having personal or professional connections to the
participants or organizations in my study.
71
Given my experience as a manager, the relationship between my experiences and
the research topic may both precede and develop during the process of this qualitative
research (Crauthers, 2011; Ponterotto, 2014). To protect my study and myself, I
implemented a method of epoché by engaging in semistructured face to face interviews,
which was similar to Ponerotto (2014). The extended length of time required for this data
collection technique could be a potential constraint to the data collection process. A
manager could have felt that he or she did not have sufficient time to participate in the
study. I provided all potential participates the opportunity to decide not to participate. I
made every effort to work with participants by finding times that best fit their schedules
to minimize conflicts with their assigned duties. Additionally, allowing too much time to
pass between data collection, data interpretation, and member checking could have led to
participants forgetting details regarding the interviews and the verification of my
interpretation of their responses being compromised (Harper & Cole, 2012; Kelty, Julian,
& Ross, 2013; Lincoln & Guba, 1985). Harper and Cole (2012) described that member
checking was a part of the quality control process as member checking provided the
participants the opportunity to review their statements for accuracy. After each
participant had confirmed the accuracy of my interpretation of their responses, I analyzed
the data for common patterns and synthesized the meaning of each participant’s
experience as it related to the themes that derived from the research findings.
An advantage of a multiple case study is that the researcher collects data from
multiple cases where large samples of similar participants are not available in the
phenomenon (Yin, 2014). The utilization of multiple case studies allowed me the 
72
opportunity to collect detailed secondary data, such as documentation. Yin (2014)
recommended the use of secondary data because it allow the researcher to access data
that would not normally to access data normally not included in other research designs.
Despite the advantages of utilizing a group or unit, one of the common criticisms is the
data collected and the findings cannot necessarily transfer to a wider population (Radley
& Chamberlain, 2012; Yin, 2014). Case study designs are believed to be too broad for
transferability (Yin, 2014) and lead to researchers giving too much attention to detail in
design, implementation, analysis, and reporting findings that only support their
interpretations (Radley & Chamberlain, 2012; Wang, Conboy, & Pikkarainen, 2012). Yin
(2014) justified the use of a template for exploratory case studies requiring strict
adherence to clarify (a) what is to be explored, (b) the purpose of the exploration, and (c)
the criteria by which the phenomenon is interpreted. Furthermore, Yin (2014) justified
the use of methodological triangulation, a technique to ensure the trustworthiness of a
finished case study. Researchers use triangulation to gather multiple perspectives of the
phenomenon to have a complete understanding of the phenomenon under study (Stake,
1995). Methodological triangulation involves the use of multiple qualitative methods to
verify if conclusions from each of the data collection methods, such as interviewing,
observation, document analysis, or any other feasible method, are the same to establish
validity of the study (Denzin & Lincoln, 2011; Houghton, Casey, Shaw, & Murphy,
2012; Yin, 2014). I used the multiple qualitative methods to verify if conclusions from
each of the data collection methods, interviewing and document analysis, were the same
to establish the validity of the study findings.
73
Semistructured interviews are used in multiple case studies instead of structured
interviews because this format allows the participants to elaborate on experiences and
leaves little room for misinterpretation (Boudville, Anjou, & Taylor, 2013). The use of
semistructured interviews for data collection may lessen the participants' accuracy and
completeness of their response due to the limited flexibility of interview questions
(Gubrium, Holstein, Marvasti, & McKinney, 2012). However, the use of open-ended
questions can be difficult to analyze and compare participants’ responses (Gubrium et al.,
2012) in following replication logic. Yin (2014) described the use of replication logic as
exploring a minimum of two to three cases to gather facts from various data sources and
draw conclusions from those facts in comparison to those of similar backgrounds. I used
a semistructured interview technique so that I could focus on the participant and ask
probing questions. Semistructured interview procedures permit researchers to probe the
participants (Whittemore, 2014). Probing participants consists of asking each participant
questions that require them to elaborate on their responses and explore further the
meaning of the phenomenon (Whittemore, 2014). I carefully selected individuals who
had all experienced the phenomenon so that I could report common descriptions of that
phenomenon.
Interviews were conducted in-person at a secure location established by each
participant and myself. Data collection through in-person interviews is advantageous
because researchers gather quotes and descriptions of what is important to the
participants while evaluating the nonverbal and paralinguistic behaviors of the
participants (Gubrium et al., 2012). However, the disadvantages of this data collection 
74
technique included the time and the expense required to complete the data collection
process (Gubrium et al., 2012). Verner and Abdullah (2012) recommended that
researchers provide study participants the opportunity to establish a private setting for the
interview to protect their confidentiality and their organization's identity. All participants
in the population received an introduction letter, and e-mail explaining the study and
participant criteria, requesting their participation and asking interested individuals to
reply to me by phone (see Appendix B). Following the introduction letter and e-mail, I
made personal telephone calls to each potential participant to answer questions and ask
for their participation.
Prior to the start of the interview, I provided each study participant a copy of an
informed consent form as well as a verbal summary explanation of what to expect,
reaffirmed the participant’s confidentiality, and the benefits of the study. I explained that
a participant could voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time without penalty, even
after data collection has ended, and that to withdraw, a participant only needed to contact
me by telephone, mail or e-mail. I also reviewed the consent form with each participant,
asked if they have any questions, concerns, or need clarification, and asked for a
signature if they were willing to participate in the interview and study. Participants
received a copy of the consent form for them to retain prior to the inception of each
interview. I stored all signed consent forms together with all other study information and
data in a locked safe that only I can access. At the end of 5 years, I will destroy all data
and paperwork by shredding copies of printed information and electronically erasing all
files on the computer.
75
In addition to data collection through in-depth face to face, semistructured
interviews, and company documentation were collected from each participant (Gibbons,
2015; Yin, 2014). Yin (2014) concluded that case study research allows the researcher to
collect several sources of data, which include document and archival records of data.
Collecting documentation and archival records was advantageous because participants
provided access to company retention information that was not available in public records
(Bryde, Broquetas, & Volm, 2013). Conversely, the disadvantages of using this data
collection method increase subjectivity regarding the participants’ preferred employee
retention strategies and the information may be unavailable, outdated, incomplete or
inaccurate (Bryde et al., 2013). Although the use of this secondary data source had
disadvantages, the advantages of requesting supporting documentation enabled me to
access data that I could not otherwise obtain. I asked each participant if he or she had any
supporting documents on employee retention strategies they use to improve employee
retention. I hoped to add to a rich description of the real-life context of the hospital
manager retention strategies as well as offer a means of triangulating the data gathered in
the interviews by collecting multiple sources of secondary data (Stake, 1995; Yin, 2014).
I asked the participants if they had any documentation or physical they use to improve
employee retention.
Davis (2013) received approval from study participants before conducting audiorecorded interviews for a study on managers’ and employees’ job satisfaction and
turnover within the federal government. Likewise, I requested and obtained approval
from Walden University's Institutional Review Board (IRB) prior to recruiting and 
76
conducting interviews with study participants as well as obtained a signed consent form
from each participant for my study records. Each interview began once a participant
signed and returned the consent form (see Appendix A). Participants who accepted the
invitation to participate in the study made their decisions on a voluntary basis and
received no gifts or compensation of any kind for their participation. On the day of each
interview, I met each participant and reintroduced the study’s purpose, reviewed with the
participant the consent and confidentiality forms, and explained the purpose of recording
the session. I told each participant that the interview would likely last up to two hours in
length or until the participant fully completed his or her responses to the interview
questions. I did not perform a pilot test prior to conducting the interviews. I encouraged
participants to ask questions to gain clarity on any questions that might cause confusion
much like what Gibbons (2015) did in a similar study. Once a participant answered all of
the interview questions; I stopped the recorder.
The interviews and company documents required data analysis and coding
(Sarvestani, Bufumbo, Geiger, & Sienko, 2012) to determine if common themes emerged
from participants in the phenomenon under study. Borrego, Foster, and Froyd (2014)
noted that researchers used conceptual frameworks to make connections and comparisons
between the literature, methodology, and results of the study. I used the conceptual
frameworks to guide my analysis and coding of the data collected. Using Maslow’s
(1943) motivation theory; Alderfer’s (1969) ERG theory; and Vroom’s (1964)
expectancy theory as conceptual framework lenses, I attempted to mitigate bias. By using
Maslow, Alderfer and Vroom theories as my personal lenses, I viewed the data through 
77
the application of these theories to understand the strategies hospitality managers need to
improve employee retention. I coded, analyzed, and compared all sources of data
collected with the established theories relevant to the phenomenon, similar to the
methods used by Thomas (2015). I completed member checking to verify my interpreted
key themes that I correlated with the literature and the conceptual frameworks.
I performed member checking by asking each participant to verify the accuracy of
my interpretation of their responses to interview questions and company employee
retention documents (Torrance, 2012). Member checking is a technique used by a
researcher to ask the participant for feedback after all of the data is collected (Stake,
1995). Incorporating member checking can help increase the credibility and
trustworthiness of the study (Chronister, Marsiglio, Linville, & Lantrip, 2014).
Participants were asked to member check my synthesized summary of their interview
responses and summarized company documents pertaining to employee retention
strategies. I used member checking in the study as a method to restate or summarize the
information received from the study participants to ensure that what was heard was
accurate, to ask for critical feedback on the findings, and to incorporate the feedback into
the findings to increase the trustworthiness of the data (Marshall & Rossman, 2011).
Tembo et al. (2013) noted that data saturation is the point in data collection when
no new information is emerging from the collected data. Saturation of the data occurs
when each additional participant provides the researcher with the same information. Data
saturation is a thorough exploration and completion of data collection (Guest et al., 2006;
Tembo et al., 2013). I recorded participants’ responses during the interviews with 
78
Audacity 2.06 recording software, and I took notes. I compiled interview responses and
analyzed them to provide each participant a summary of the themes that emerged during
the interview. Compiling a summary of themes allows study participants to verify the
accuracy and meaning of their responses to use in compiling common themes among
participants (Marshall & Rossman, 2011). I compiled data throughout the study to
identify themes and to determine when the data reached saturation.
Data Organization Technique
Anyan (2013) and Luo (2011) proposed that implementing appropriate data
organization techniques maintains the integrity of transcribed recorded interviews, audiorecorded copies of interviews, and backup copies of the recorded interviews as part of the
data storage process. In the first step of the coding process, I used codes that uniquely
identified the three interviewed participants by letter and number. The code letters were
“P” for the participant, and the numbers were one through three. In the next step, I
implemented Yin’s (2011) 5-step approach to data analysis to identify concepts or themes
that were apparent in the data. In the following subsection, I provide a detailed process of
each step. Davis (2013) suggested transcribing interviews in a Microsoft Word document
and then uploading raw data to NVivo v10. I uploaded the interview transcripts data into
NVivo v10 software and used NVivo to organize the coding for data analysis. NVivo v10
software enabled me to organize the raw data into themes identified through my literature
review and conceptual framework.
Once each participant verified his or her responses to the interview questions, the
transcribed data were axial coded or examined and categorized into code. I coded my 
79
reflexive journal notes to mitigate any bias and tracked the codes in NVivo v10 software
to organize the text data, code the text, manipulate the text data, and display the codes
(Bergin, 2011). Da Mota Pedrosa, Näslund, and Jasmand (2012) explained the use of
coding as a part of an analysis in which the researcher labels and groups data according to
content. The coding process is advantageous because the researcher can identify each
subject as described by the participant and group common perspectives among all
participants (Da Mota Pedrosa et al., 2012; Davis, 2013; Harnish, 2012).
After the interview data collection, I filed transcripts in electronic folders on my
computer to ensure they were not lost, misplaced, or altered. It is essential to maintain the
transcribed recorded interviews, the audio-recorded copy of interviews, and backup
copies of the recorded interviews as part of the data storage process (Anayan, 2013;
Davis, 2013; Gajewski, 2013). I kept backup copies of all files and data so that if they
were damaged, destroyed or lost; I would not have to replicate the entire study process
again to collect new data. Davis (2013) and Gajewski (2013) suggested the use of
nonpersonally identifiable labels to maintain information in the utmost confidential
manner. Davis and Gajewski agreed that participants’ information should not be
disclosed at any time during or after completion of the study. I used one main folder and
named it retention strategies and the subfolders were named P1 through P3. I used a
research spreadsheet log to monitor and update data collected from each participant on
the research phenomenon. Following each in-depth interview, I used the raw interview
notes to transcribe the interview into narratives to elaborate on initial observations using
rich descriptions of the data I received from the participants.
80
Gajewksi (2013), Davis (2013), and Anyan (2013) proposed the use of a master
file of journal notes, company documents, and data including labeling files of the
recorded and written transcripts. I created a master file of journal notes and data that
included labeling files of the recorded and written transcripts. I gathered all the data
material, assembled it into one electronic file, and appropriately labeled all material. I
create an archival information sheet to explain any missing materials. I am the only
person with access to the data files. I plan to secure files in my locked home safe and a
password protected the personal computer for 5 years after the completion of the study.
At the end of the 5-year period, all paper files will be shredded, and electronic files will
be destroyed.
Data Analysis
I used Yin’s (2014) data analysis method to identify and highlight the hospitality
managers’ retention strategies that study participants described during the interviews.
Yin’s (2014) data analysis involves a researcher working with the research data to
discover meaningful themes, patterns, and descriptions that answer the central research.
From the interviews of hospitality managers included in my study, I analyzed the
descriptions of their experiences to explore the phenomenon in a real-life setting (Yin,
2014).
After I had completed data collection and organization, I began the analysis. First,
I organized the collected data into categories that I identified through the literature
review. The initial categories pertaining to employee retention strategies that were used
are (a) creating an employee-centered environment, (b) equating job performance to job 
81
outcomes, (c) developing a positive relationship exchange, (d) making the job more
satisfactory, (e) recruitment and selection, (f) compensation, (g) coaching opportunities,
and (h) developing retention strategies. These categories are a starting point for deciding
what categories currently exist in the three hospitality organizations included in this study
and based on previous researchers. My data collected from the hospitality managers were
the real indicator of the final categories. When a participant introduces another category,
Thomas (2015) proposed establishing additional categories and review previous
interviews for information that I should have included in the new category.
In addition to using categories that I derived from the findings from the literature
review, I analyzed data in view of Maslow’s (1943) motivation theory, Alderfer’s (1969)
ERG theory, and Vroom’s (1964) expectancy theory. I used these conceptual frameworks
to help me interpret the meaning of data collected. By examining retention strategies
through the lens of Maslow’s (1943) motivation theory; Alderfer’s (1969) existence,
ERG theory; and, Vroom’s (1964) expectancy theory I compared the data collected with
established theories relevant to the phenomenon.
Yin’s 5-step approach to data analysis is used to analyze data enable researchers
to analyze the textual data (Yin, 2011). Yin’s (2011) process included the following 5-
steps: (1) compiling the data; (2) disassembling the data; (3) reassembling the data; (4)
interpreting the meaning of the data; and (5) concluding the data. In step one, I compiled
the data to develop groupings. For step two, I disassembled the data to reduce and
eliminate invariant themes of the phenomenon. In step three, I reassembled the data and
cluster core themes. For step four, I checked patterns against the interview transcripts, 
82
reflexive journal, and documents to interpret the meaning of the data. Finally, in step 5, I
concluded or summarized the data into an individual structural description of the
experiences.
In order to ensure that I did not develop a biased view of the phenomenon under
study, I coded and analyzed the participant interviews and company documents
pertaining to employee retention to examine if the findings from all of the multiple
methods lead me to draw the same or similar conclusions (Denzin & Lincoln, 2011).
Denzin (1978) described methodological triangulation as a principle strategy using more
than one method to gather data. I used methodological triangulation to analyze data
collected. I reviewed transcribed recordings of the interview, reflective journal notes, and
documentation to identify patterns and themes to categorize themes regarding hospitality
managers’ strategies for improving employee retention.
Trotter (2012) described NVivo v10 as the qualitative software used by
researchers for coding thematic categories and extracting themes from a research
interview to answer the research question. I used NVivo v10 software to organize the text
data, code the text, manipulates the text data, and display the codes (Bergin, 2011). After
the interviews, I transcribed and analyzed the data using the five-step data analysis
process recommended by Yin (2011). Next, I exported the text data into NVivo v10 to
correlate themes with the literature and the conceptual framework in this study. Similar to
Gibbons (2015), I coded and analyzed my reflexive journal to determine if themes
emerged from my experience of the phenomenon using NVivo v10 software to organize
the text data, code the text, manipulate the text data, and display the codes (Bergin, 
83
2011). I collected company documents on employee retention strategies from the
participants to code and categorize the emerged themes from the documents in NVivo
v10 software to organize the text data, code the text, manipulate the text data, and display
the codes (Bergin, 2011).
Morse and Coulehan (2015) concluded that data collection conducted in a
qualitative research study encompasses ongoing data collection and analysis
simultaneously. This design fosters a process of making sense of qualitative data and
requires the creation of patterns and themes from complex data (Zheng, Guo, Dong, &
Owens, 2015). As noted previously, the purpose of this qualitative multiple case study
was to explore the strategies hospitality managers need to improve employee retention.
Bedwell, McGowan, and Lavender (2015) proposed the use of qualitative data analysis to
uncover and gain insight on themes, patterns, concepts, insights, and understandings of
the phenomenon. Specifically, I focused on compiling identified retention strategies used
to improve employee retention.
To make comparisons in emerged themes within each interview, Zheng et al.
(2015) proposed that the researcher compare responses. I compared the answers to the
interview questions to identify common themes in experiences among participants
(Bedwell et al., 2015; Senden et al., 2015) by continuously examining and categorizing
themes reciprocally while analyzing interview responses and company employee
retention documents until the data reached saturation (Davis, 2013; Senden et al., 2015).
Oberoi, Jiwa, McManus, and Hodder (2015) concluded that data saturation could be a
signal to the researcher there is little need for conducting more research.
84
Data saturation in this study was reached when I identified sufficient information
to replicate the study and the participants’ and my analysis of the company employee
retention documents provided redundant information (Guest et al., 2006; Senden et al.,
2015). Yin (2014) argued that researchers could select at least two cases when seeking to
understand and compare situations. Exploring more than two cases produced even richer
study results (Yin, 2014). I included three cases in my study. I collected and sorted all
research data into themes to correlate the key themes with the literature conceptual
frameworks used in this study. I used member checking again during my data analysis to
verify the interpretation of all the data collected from the study (Oberoi et al., 2015;
Senden et al., 2015). I analyzed and interpreted the data to monitor when the data reached
saturation (Guest et al., 2006; Morse & Coulehan, 2015; Senden et al., 2015).
Reliability and Validity
The concepts of validity and reliability are quantitative concepts (Marshall &
Rossman, 2011), which are not appropriate to use in describing qualitative research
reliability and validity. Ali and Yusof (2011) recommended that researchers provide data
trustworthiness in qualitative research, which includes (a) credibility, (b) transferability,
(c) dependability, and (d) confirmability (Jacob & Furgerson, 2012; Marshall &
Rossman, 2011). These are quality measures for qualitative research that are equivalent to
reliability and validity in quantitative research (Ali & Yusof, 2011; Marshall & Rossman,
2011). In addition, Yin (2014) justified the use of triangulation strategies by researchers
to strengthen their qualitative case studies through the implementation of more than one
data collection method. 
85
Research credibility ensures that research findings take into account all of the
complexities that present themselves in the study and explore patterns not explained
(Coast & Horrocks, 2010). I established the credibility and trustworthiness of my study
by the implementation of appropriate steps to maintain the highest level of academic
research standards. I adhered to the strict Walden University Institutional Review Board
research guidelines to mitigate bias (Frels & Onwuegbuzie, 2013). A mixture of the
appropriate methods and instruments strengthens the trustworthiness of exploring
employee retention through the implementation of retention strategies (Frels &
Onwuegbuzie, 2013). Each participant was asked to verify my summarized
interpretations of their responses to determine the accuracy of the transcriptions and my
interpretations of the meanings of their responses (Ben-Ari & Enosh, 2011; Dyment &
O’Connell, 2011). I used member checking to verify the summarized data information
gathered during data collection. Lincoln and Guba (1985) argued that member checking
related to the accuracy of the data collected might demonstrate that an accurate picture of
the phenomenon was being presented. Prior to and during the data analysis, participants
were asked to verify my synthesis of their interview responses. I asked the participants to
verify my synthesized interpretation of the emerged themes from their interviews and
company documentation (Marshall & Rossman, 2011). Giving the participants an
opportunity to review my synthesized interpretations of their viewpoints and company
documents allowed them to ensure the accuracy of my interpretation of their perceptions
regarding the strategies needed for improving employee retention.
Lincoln and Guba (1985) described transferability as the trustworthiness measure 
86
used to develop descriptive and context relevant statements that could transfer to other
populations or settings. Thus, research transferability refers to the consistency in the
study procedures each time a different researcher conducts the research (Donatelli & Lee,
2013). I attempted to assure the transferability of my study methods by carefully
documenting and describing the entire research process. I prepared and presented a
detailed description of the research process to allow another reader to transfer this
process to a different research setting (Marshall & Rossman, 2011); however,
transferability is left up to the reader of the research to decide (Marshall & Rossman,
2011).
A researcher's focus on dependability is on ensuring the strength of the data
(Marshall & Rossman, 2011). I used the same semistructured interview questions and
requested each participant to provide employee retention strategy documents throughout
the data collection process to enhance internal consistency. Enhancing the internal
consistency of asking each participant the same set of interview questions could increase
the dependability of receiving a similar answer to each question that I included in the list
of interview questions. The use of a set of semistructured interview questions and
requesting secondary data from each participant was a technique that I used to help assure
that a sufficient amount of data was collected to identify when the data reached a point of
saturation (Guest et al., 2006). Without the use of semistructured interview questions and
requesting each participant to provide employee retention strategies documents, reaching
saturation in the data would have been difficult (Guest et al., 2006).
Lincoln and Guba (1985) described confirmability as a degree of neutrality in the 
87
study findings shaped by the participants and the researcher’s interest. I assured
confirmability through member checking and the documentation of procedures for
checking and rechecking the data during the data collection process. I asked participants
to review my summarized interpretations of their responses to verify that I captured the
intended meaning of their responses. Marshall and Rossman (2011) noted that member
checking enables the researcher to share data and their interpretations with participants so
that each participant may review data to ensure the integrity, trustworthiness, and
accuracy of the findings. Reviewing the data for accuracy after analysis and interpretation
of data can decrease the incidence of incorrect information (Marshall & Rossman, 2011).
The greatest benefit of the member checking was participants verified and corrected the
data collected from the beginning to the end of the data analysis (Chronister et al., 2014).
The participants’ confirmation of my summarized interpretations of the key themes that
emerged from their responses to the interview questions and company employee retention
strategies documentation, which I also correlated with the literature and the conceptual
framework, increased the confirmability of the study (Frels & Onwuegbuzie, 2013;
Lincoln & Guba, 1985).
Lincoln and Guba (1985) recommended that a researcher continue collecting data
until no new data or information is collected to assure data saturation. I concurrently
collected, analyzed, and coded the interviews and company employee retention strategy
documents to identify when the data reached saturation. Data saturation in this study
occurred when sufficient depth of information and redundancy of data were reached
(Devlen et al., 2014; Guest et al., 2006). By systematically checking the data, I conducted
88
ongoing analysis of the data and confirmed the accuracy through follow up member
checking. Engaging in continued referencing between data and analysis I hoped to
increase the trustworthiness of a study (Marshall & Rossman, 2011).
Yin (2014) noted that the collection of multiple sources of data such as
interviews, field notes and secondary data collection support triangulating evidence of the
study. I established the trustworthiness of the study by using methodological
triangulation. To triangulate data for a case study, Oleinik (2011) and Yin (2014) argued
collecting multiple measures of the same phenomenon. I used semistructured interviews
and requested company documents pertaining to employee retention strategies. In
addition to collecting multiple data sources, I reported back to the participants my
preliminary findings to ask for feedback on my findings to verify the accuracy of the key
categories generated by my interpretation of their responses and summary of company
documents pertaining to employee retention strategies to create a rich description of the
data (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). Furthermore, to achieve an honest examination for
achieving trustworthiness I used methodological triangulation. The use of methodological
triangulation increases the trustworthiness of a case study (Denzin & Lincoln, 2011;
Stake, 1995; Yin, 2014). I submitted the proposed case study for review by a doctoral
study committee including a professional methodologist to ensure a proper peer
evaluation and debriefing.
Transition and Summary
The topics in Section 2 included my role as the researcher, the study participants,
the research method and design, the study population and sample, ethical research 
89
practices, data collection, data analysis technique, and the dependability and credibility of
the research. I explained how the qualitative case study research design applied to
conduct this study and compile results. In this study, I used qualitative research methods
in the form of an exploratory case study research design to explore some hospitality
managers’ retention strategies that have been effective in improving employee retention. I
collected data implementing a self-developed interview protocol with three hospitality
managers. I also included a discussion of the data collection instrument and technique,
data organization techniques, and data analysis in this section. An explanation of how I
established credibility, transferability, dependability, confirmability, and methodological
triangulation followed.
In Section 3, I presented the findings of this study. The findings included a
detailed description of the analysis of the semistructured interview responses of the
managers and the themes that emerged to answer the research question for this study. In
addition, in Section 3 I included a discussion and presentation of the application of the
results and findings of professional practice and implications for social change. I
summarized key findings and made recommendations for further study actions. I ended
Section 3 with a summary and conclusion.

Section 3: Application to Professional Practice and Implications for Change
In Section 3, I provided a detailed review of the data collected, the conceptual
framework, and the findings related to the research question. Included in this section are
an overview of the study, presentation of the findings, application to professional
practice, implications for social change, and recommendations for action. This section
ends with recommendations for further studies, reflections on my experience, and a
summary of the study conclusions.
Introduction
The purpose of this qualitative multiple case study was to explore the strategies
hospitality managers need to improve employee retention. Previous scholars thoroughly
explored and examined employee retention (Davis, 2013; Thomas, 2015). However, the
goal of this research was to study this phenomenon specifically in the context of the
hospitality industry. I conducted interviews with three hospitality managers from
different mid-sized hospitality organizations in Brevard County, Florida. Participants
provided their real-life experiences with applying employee retention strategies in their
hospitality organizations. In addition to semistructured interviews, I also reviewed
company retention policies, Employee Handbooks, newsletters, and my reflective journal
to triangulate and confirm interview data. I scheduled the semistructured interviews at an
offsite location in a private meeting room near the three companies. Interviews did not
last more than 60 minutes.
I analyzed all the data and identified 12 core emergent themes. The emergent
themes showed the strategies noted in company documents and the participants’ views, 
91
experience, and perceptions regarding retention strategies to answer the central research
question. Based on the research question and analysis of interview responses as well as
company documents (see Appendix F), I identified four main themes: (a) the
motivational outcome; (b) leadership characteristics; (c) most effective retention
strategies; and (d) the least effective strategies influencing employee retention. The
conceptual summary of employees’ motivations were (a) personal growth and fulfillment,
(b) rewards and recognition, (c) workplace relationships, and (d) performance
expectations. The essential leadership characteristics for retaining hospitality employees
included (a) team building, (b) empowering employees, and (c) effective communication.
Effective strategies for improving hospitality employee retention were (a) promoting
communication, (b) supporting employee development, and (c) recruitment and selection.
The least effective strategies for improving hospitality employee retention were
negotiating and compensation.
Presentation of the Findings
A case study approach serves as an efficient way to investigate a phenomenon in
multiple real-life settings (Cronin, 2014; Yin, 2014). The overarching research question
for this study was: What strategies do hospitality managers need to improve employee
retention? Three hospitality managers in mid-sized hospitality organizations were
selected based on their experience with implementing employee retention strategies.
Interviews with the participants took place in a setting where participants felt comfortable
with providing detailed responses to each semistructured interview question (see
Appendix C). In addition to semistructured interviews, Employee Handbooks and other 
92
business records regarding retention strategies was reviewed to triangulate and confirm
interview data from three cases (see Appendix F). The sample Case 1 was one participant
(P1) comprised of the general manager representing company C1. The sample Case 2 was
one participant (P2) comprised of assistant general manager representing company C2.
The sample size for Case 3 was one participant (P3)comprised of general manager
representing company C3.
I obtained company retention policies from company C1 and company C3.
Hospitality managers utilize the company retention policy for employee retention,
company policies, or for specific categories of records to ensure legal compliance. P1 and
P3 corroborated the findings identified in their companies’ retention policy. Company
retention policy indicated minimum retention periods are suggested (e.g., 30 day or 90-
day probationary periods) and an employee’s retention period depends on the general
guidelines covered in the company policy as well as any other pertinent factors. The
company retention policy is not a contract between the organization and the employees.
The company C1, C2, and C3 provided copies of their 2015 Employee
Handbooks. Each Employee Handbooks included a general summary description of the
personnel policies, programs, and employee benefits. The Company C1 and Company C2
provided company newsletters dated June 2015. The Company C3provided company
newsletters dated March 2015 and June 2015. Company newsletters presented
information on company annual property, district, and regional events at the organization.
All the participants explained that the company newsletters were available for all 
93
management and employees. Copies were available electronically, in the employee
breakroom, and administrative offices (P1, P2, & P3).
I used Yin’s 5-step approach (Yin, 2011) to form the basis for analysis of the data
collected for this study. As reported in Section 2, I used the NVivo v10 software to input
and store data for coding and exploration of themes while maintaining the confidentiality
of research participants. I used member checking to check for accuracy and ensured that I
captured the meaning of each participant's responses. Following the collection and
analysis of data collected, I reviewed company retention documents regarding retention
strategies and my reflective journal to triangulate and confirm the semistructured
interview data. Twelve themes emerged from the data, which I grouped into four main
themes. The four main themes were (a) the motivational outcome, (b) leadership
characteristics, (c) the most effective retention strategies, and (d) the least effective
strategies influencing employee retention.
The conceptual frameworks for this research were Maslow’s (1943) motivation
theory, Alderfer’s (1969) ERG theory, and Vroom’s (1964) expectancy theory. Within
this study, I reviewed all three frameworks as related to the study findings in order to
gain a better understanding of the strategies hospitality managers need to improve
employee retention. Many of the company retention documents and participant responses
supported Maslow's, Aderfer's, and Vroom's motivational theories.
Emergent Theme One: Employee Motivations for Retaining Hospitality Employees
The results interpreted from the conceptual summary of employees’ motivations
(see Table 2) were based on participants' responses to what motivational strategies they 
94
use to retain employees. Based on the coded responses of the managers and company
retention documents, I identified the motivation strategies based on Maslow’s (1943)
motivational theory, Alderfer’s (1969) ERG theory, and Vroom’s (1964) expectancy
theory motivation in the workplace. P2 claimed managers need to implement more than
one strategy to motivate employees. Based on findings from previous research (Cerasoli,
Nicklin, & Ford, 2014), managers can not assume that employees feel valued just because
they continue to be productive, nor that a strategy that motivates one employee, in terms
of recognition and reward, will work for others.
Given the emergent themes from the employee motivational strategies for
hospitality managers to improve employee retention (see Table 2), participants provided
responses that aligned with company documents, the motivation theory, ERG theory, and
expectancy theory. I summarized the coding of the participants’ answers to interview
questions and company employee retention strategies through company documents
regarding the alignment with Maslow's (1943), Alderfer’s (1969), and Vroom’s (1964)
theories that can lead to improved retention in the workplace. The emerged themes were
(a) personal growth and fulfillment, (b) rewards and recognition, (c) workplace
relationships, and (d) performance expectations, which were confirmed in previous
research by Bassey (2012); Galletta, Portoghese, & Battistelli, (2011); Gill, Sharma,
Mathur, and Bhutani, (2012); and Ping, Bahaudin, Mujtaba, and Whetten (2012).

Addressing personal growth and fulfillment. When managers apply the
motivation theory by Maslow (1943) within the work environment, their management
practices will entail the creation of a work environment in which employees can reach
their full potential. Two study participants agreed that employees seek more from their
jobs than the typical ideals of accomplishing tasks. P2 indicated, “I look for employees
who are seeking out additional responsibility because they are more likely to be rewarded
with greater compensation and the opportunity for better positions.” A review of the C2
Employee Handbook validated P2’s remarks by revealing that managers can fill
organizational vacancies by promoting an employee to a vacant position. P3 proclaimed
that developing an employee’s ability to be responsible when working independently not
only benefits P3 as a manager but also enables the employee to grow personally.
DiPietro, Kline, and Nierop (2014) concluded that motivating employees and finding 
96
opportunities for keeping them satisfied are some of the ways that managers retain
employees without jeopardizing excellent customer service.
The study participants spoke of the importance of addressing the personal growth
and fulfillment needs of employees who seek to grow within the organization. P1
declared, “One way for a person to develop is to further educate themselves." In a review
of company documentation, I noted that companies placed a high value on education. The
wages and benefits section of the C1 Employee Handbook revealed that organizational
leadership could use educational reimbursements as a representation of a strategy in the
company’s greater retention efforts. Educational benefits are not limited to tuition
reimbursement programs of current members of the company leadership team, as found
in C1 company retention document (Employee Handbook, March 2015). In fact, C3
partners with specific colleges and offer tuition discounts and incentives to employees
and leadership members who attend (Employee Handbook, January 2015). P3
acknowledged education is a valued commodity in the business world, and their company
encourages ample opportunity for an individual to grow. Latif, Jan, and Shaheen (2013)
noted that training is a means for development and an important factor in fostering a
sense of advancement. In a review of the company operational documents, I noticed that
C3 policy’s is to promote from within whenever possible, provided the person is the bestqualified individual for the available position (Employee Handbook, January 2015). Alsharafi and Rajiani (2013) found that realistically inspiring employees is a factor in
motivation and retention, and can be accomplished if hospitality leaders notify employees
of the possibilities for growth within the company. 
97
Motivation is a force that energizes people to do what they do, and comes from
either inside the employees or from their environment (Coastes, 2015; Karahanna, 2015).
In the pursuit to satisfy and resatisfy needs, motivation is the driving force; for both
Maslow (1943) and Alderfer’s (1969) ERG theory, the pursuit occurs from a motive to
act. Maslow stated a person’s need produces the drive and desire that motivates an
individual to satisfy that need. In a review of the all three of the companies' retention
documents, I noticed that each organization strives to create an environment with policies
that enhance individual and organizational forms of motivation (Employee Handbook,
January 2015; Employee Handbook, March 2015; Employee Handbook, June 2014).
Employee rewards and recognition. In expectancy theory, Vroom (1964) stated
that an extrinsic motivation links to an individual's intended outcomes. Purvis et al.
(2015) concluded that expectancy theory is used to explain employee motivation, and
Vroom (1964) emphasized that motivation is a multiplicative function of the personal
attractiveness of the rewards that follow achievement of the organizational outcome. P2
and P3 claimed that, for some individuals, pay is the most important outcome of working.
For other employees, a feeling of accomplishment is more important than pay (P2, P3).
Yamamoto (2011) indicated that rewards systems add value to an employee’s
commitment to their organization. Therefore, employees perform in certain ways if they
believe a reward will follow (Vroom, 1964).
The March 2015 and June 2015 newsletters from C1 and C3 included information
regarding reward efforts on an individual and companywide basis to promote creative,
energetic, and passionate locations dedicated to a high standard of excellence. All three 
98
participants mentioned themed lunches, cultural celebrations with music and dance, and
talent shows through the year to boost employee morale. The findings from all three
Employee Handbooks indicated extravagant award banquets, rewards for employees in
the forms of trips or cash, and spot awards recognition programs that include gifts of
movie tickets, free parking for a week, gift cards, and other rewards to maintain a
workplace with opportunities for workers to feel valued (Employee Handbook, January
2015; Employee Handbook, March 2015; Employee Handbook, June 2014). Kim (2014)
indicated that company leaders should establish a recognition strategy to acknowledge
employees for their achievement and work to promote retention.
P2 mentioned that the use of providing nonfinancial rewards or even changing the
nature of the job itself. Psychological research has shown that motivation is influenced by
numerous factors, including the organization's environment, organizational culture,
individual characteristics, comparison across individuals, and the structure and form of
existing incentives (Karahanna, 2015). In a review of all the company retention
documents, C1, C2, and C3 meet employees' physiological needs need by providing
break times for meals and snacks as well as adequate salary for the employees to house
and feed their families. Maslow (1943) concluded that when these needs are not met
employees will not focus other needs. In the Employee Handbooks, the companies
mentioned providing a safe work environment with minimal job hazards and free from
threats from other employees (Employee Handbook, January 2015; Employee Handbook,
March 2015; Employee Handbook, June 2014). To validate Maslow’s claim, Alderfer
concluded employees have an existence motivational need in the workplace that include 
99
feeling safe in the work environment (Alderfer, 1969).
Workplace relationships. Both P1 and P2 indicated that most employees keep
working with enthusiasm as they build relationships with their management.
Management plays a vital role in creating better workplace relationships and addressing
employee concerns (Gayathri, Sivaraman, & Kamalambal, 2012). Reviews of the
companies’ retention documents confirmed P1 and P2 commented that interaction and
communication with coworkers and supervisors in a team environment can increase job
satisfaction and productivity (Employee Handbook, March 2015; Employee Handbook,
June 2014). Panagiotakopoulos (2014) indicated that improved communication between
the management team and employees improves employee relations within an
organization and creates a more harmonious environment. P1 and P3 stated that their
companies supported them by showing kindness beyond the work environments to build
relationships. C1 and C3 June 2015 company newsletters confirmed P1 and P3
comments; managers and employees are encouraged to share organizational and personal
goals to be featured in an upcoming newsletter article. The C2 Employee Handbook
indicated that policies, tools, and ways of working together to make a difference in the
company culture and to strengthen retention, boost associate engagement results, and
loyalty to C2 (Employee Handbook, June 2014).
Maslow (1943) maintained that the basic need for belonging is a precursor for
motivation and self-esteem. As noted in a review of company retention documents and
company newsletters, all three companies have social building activities to increase
employee motivation and engagement (Employee Handbook, June 2014; Employee 
100
Handbook, January 2015; Employee Handbook, March 2015). P3 declared companies
that are focused on business the entire time face higher turnover than those that take the
time to make employees feel valued. Managers can help employees satisfy their need for
belongingness, as implied by Maslow (1943), by promoting social functions such as
company picnics and holiday parties.
All three company newsletters mentioned that addressing employee social needs
(Maslow, 1943), and relatedness needs (Alderfer, 1969) through social interaction and
teamwork. All three participants mentioned that on a daily basis they encourage
teamwork and respect among coworkers. Chon et al. (2013) summarized that the
hospitality industry as an industry is heavily based on dedication to a pleasant
environment and friendly interaction with others. P3 mentioned that the hospitality
industry is based on the personal and professional interaction between management and
employees. The C1 Employee Handbook indicated that the organization strives to help
the employees feel they are part of the C3 family (Employee Handbook, January 2015).
All three participants proclaimed that it was impossible for their organizations to offer
simplistic strategies on how to increase employees' motivation. However, all three of the
companies provide management with training to address employee concerns in order to
minimize an employee feeling undervalued (Employee Handbook, January 2015;
Employee Handbook, March 2015; Employee Handbook, June 2014).
Performance expectations. According to Vroom's expectancy theory, managers
can promote high levels of motivation in their environment by taking steps to ensure that
performance expectations are communicated (Vroom, 1964). P2 stated employees are 
101
motivated to produce results if they feel valued, understand where they fit in the
organization, and how the job's responsibilities link to the organization's goals. As
businesses change, managers must articulate their optimism regarding their vision to
employees, consider individual needs, and provide meaning for employee tasks
(Panagiotakopoulos, 2014). The findings of Mohsin, Lengler, and Aguzzoli (2015)
explained that employees who find their job not sufficiently challenging, do not clearly
understand managers’ expectations, and who would like to establish potential through
performance, lose interest in their jobs and are more likely to quit.
Alderfer (1969) summarized that the fulfillment of individual needs has a
significant role in human motivation. In my literature review, I noted that Vroom (1964)
argued that an employee is motivated under three conditions: (a) their efforts will result
in acceptable performance; (b) acceptable performance will lead to the desired outcome
or reward; and (c) the reward is valuable. Managers who demonstrate Vroom’s
expectancy theory of motivation increase the likelihood of an employee acting out the
desired behavior (Jodlbauer et al., 2012). Individuals seek to satisfy their need for selfactualization needs through the desire to have the opportunity to use their skills and
abilities to the fullest extent possible (Maslow, 1943).
All of the participants suggested that employees are more likely to stay longer
with their employing organization when they receive ample support from management
through the communication of expectations. In a review of the documents from all three
companies, I noted that performance review programs are designed for (a) workforce
inspiration, (b) position and conduct improvement, (c) correct directorial aims, and (d) 
102
nurturing optimistic associations between supervision and workforce. P3 explained
performance reviews are not one-sided. For example, P3 pointed out that managers use
these reviews to identify areas in their organizations that require improvement with
respect to employees' performance expectations. Employees seek feedback on their skills
and work performance from management to increase productivity and responsiveness in
meeting organizational goals (P1; McCole et al., 2012).
Nwokocha and Iheriohanma (2012) argued that employee retention is easier to
achieve when employees feel proud of the job they do in the organization and when they
are recognized for their job performance. Thus, in attempting to influence motivation,
managers need to make sure employees feel they will succeed if they try hard (Vroom,
1964). The C3 retention documents also decreed that unrealistic goals place indirect
pressure on associates to compromise the company’s ethical standards.
Damij, Levnajić, Skrt, and Suklan (2015) concluded that employee motivation
significantly increases productivity levels and work performance. In this study, I viewed
the data through the three theories to understand the strategies that hospitality managers
are using to improve employee retention in their organizations. Some of the participants
implied that employee motivation is behaviorally specific, and managers need to think
about specific motivational strategies to stimulate employees in a particular job rather
than an individual’s overall role (P2, P3). Employee motivation leads to worker
development, which is essential in the hospitality industry (Galletta et al., 2011). Two
participants emphasized the importance of understanding employee motivations and
incorporating human motivational factors into retention strategies to improve the 
103
effectiveness of the retention strategies (P2, P3). When managers combine motivational
strategies, employee retention strategies, and real-life experiences together, managers can
use employee motivation as a means for personal growth and rewards (Damij et al.,
2015). All three of the companies’ newsletters featured information about employees
doing extraordinary things to help customers and, in some instances, their community. In
addition to participants answering all questions asked during the interview, a review of
company documents including an Employee Handbook revealed the organizations utilize
newsletters to motivate workers to do positive things for customers and the community
(Maslow, 1943; Reflective Journal, July 12, 2015).
Emergent Theme Two: Leadership Characteristics for Retaining Hospitality
Employees
Shore (2013) posited that business leaders should take an interest in the
implementation of essential retention strategies. P1 stated, “Management’s job is to use
the numerous years of hospitality experience in leadership to impact a reduction in
turnover positively.” A manager’s ability to necessitate cordiality, as proposed by P3,
leads to a more motivated worker who performs to their best and stays longer with the
organization. Table 3 displays the core themes that emerged from my data analysis
regarding leadership characteristics that improve the retention of hospitality employees in
the three hospitality organizations included in this study.
Leadership characteristics that emerged from the data analysis include (a) team
builder qualities, (b) empowering employees, and (c) effective communicator. The
frequency of occurrence of core themes demonstrated the leadership characteristics in 
104
retaining employees (see Table 3). Through company documents and participant
interview responses, the findings of the study revealed the leadership practices needed for
successful retention efforts, which align with previous research by Abeysekera and
Jayakody (2011).
Table 3
Frequency of Themes for Leadership Characteristics that Improve the Retention of
Hospitality Employees
Theme n % of frequency of occurrence
Team builder 4 30.76%
Empowering employees 3 23.07%
Effective communicator 6 46.15%
Note: n=frequency
Team builder. All three study participants showed a strong desire to foster
cohesive team climate with their subordinates, specifically concerning building teams and
creating positive work environments. P1 stated that employees enter the workplace
seeking their sense of community and connection with the work environment. Dike
(2012) argued that a good leader is one who leads their organization to achieve business
growth through performance and teams. In the review of C1 and C3 companies’ retention
policies, managers are encouraged to include encouragement of employees to build
cohesive working cultures where employees earn group awards, recognition, and
opportunities for professional growth. Employee Handbooks noted at least one program
in C1 and C2 that included a description how managers should unify their employees 
105
through high energy, celebration, and collective intelligence for corporate teambuilding
(Employee Handbook, June 2014; Employee Handbook, March 2015).
Empowering employees. Previous research provided clues to the needs and
challenges of workplace empowerment, which warrants the need for managers to use
empowerment as a retention strategy to retain employees. P1 stated that workplace
empowerment has an influence on the retention of employees. Abdel-Hadi (2012)
concluded that employees create self-fulfilling prophesies when they create their path to
success by reflecting on their past victories. Both P2 and P3 recommended increasing
opportunities for employee empowerment and development. P3 stated employees’
opportunities for job enrichment play a significant role in improving retention.
Gill et al. (2012) found that employee empowerment encourages retention and
strengthens an organization’s operation. In addition to expressing confidence and
empowering employees, P2 pointed out another way for managers to boost employee
expectancy levels and motivation is by providing training to ensure that employees have
all the expertise they need for high performance. In my review of the literature, I found
that Russ (2011) claimed employees who do not perceive the reward outcome as
something of value could leave the organization. All three company Employee
Handbooks revealed that managers could recommend an employee for leadership training
programs. C1 and C2 have developed programs designed for an employee with the
potential to become a part of the management team and to progress within the
organization (Employee Handbook, June 2014; Employee Handbook, March 2015).
However, the C2 company’s Employee Handbook indicated the employee must have an
106
undergraduate degree before applying to educational leadership programs (Employee
Handbook, March 2015).
Effective communicator. AlBattat and Som (2013) argued that managementemployee relations lead to preservation. P2 and P3 stated management plays a vital role
and is a determining factor in influencing workers to stay with an organization. Quek
(2011) pointed out that involvement employees in institutional goals decrease employee
turnover. The findings from the C2 Employee Handbook indicated how the company
vision is aimed at building and sustaining an inclusive environment where our associates
are embraced and valued for who they are (Employee Handbook, June 2014).
P1 stated managers should receive as many messages as they send, pay attention
to those messages received, be a good listener, and be empathetic. P2 claimed effective
communication is important to meet the company goals on a daily basis. Managers must
communicate with their employees when providing positive and negative reinforcement
(P2). Murphy and Johnson (2011) explained that leaders, specifically authentic leaders,
are intensely aware of their environment, and demonstrate determination, poise, and
optimism. P1 claimed that seeking feedback from employees continued to play a critical
role in the organization.
Wong and Laschinger (2013) noted that managers who emphasized transparency,
balanced processing, self-awareness, and high ethical standards increased employee job
satisfaction and performance. In a review of C1 retention documents, the responsibility of
the hospitality organization managerial associates, officers, and directors included the
expectation to set the right tone and lead by example through the creation of the right 
107
environment. All three of the Employee Handbook documents supported the responses of
both P1 and P2 by revealing that managers are encouraged to adopt open door policies
for the benefit of communicating openly with associates (Employee Handbook, June
2014; Employee Handbook, March 2015).
Emergent Theme Three: Effective Strategies for Improving Hospitality Employee
Retention
In the third theme, participants and company retention documents emphasized
effective strategies for retaining employees. Ezulike (2012) argued that as a human
relations best practice, each organization has their set of effective retention policies in
place to address rewards and recognition, employee development, and compensation. The
Employee Handbook and newsletter from March 2015 indicated how management at C3
believes the wellbeing of their employees are fundamental to the success of their business
because employees are the ones who provide hospitality to their guests each day. The
demand for retaining employees makes having effective retention strategies in place more
of a need than a desire for businesses (Thomas, 2015). All of the participants revealed
promoting communication between the managers and the employees, supporting
employee professional development, and strategic planning for employee retention during
hiring and recruitment of new employees were effective.
One of the hospitality managers, P3, opined, “A manager's retention strategy that
goes beyond compensation can be employed to retain employees and are sometimes just
as effective as compensation.” P2 claimed, “Employee engagement, communication, and
inclusion are some examples of approaches that I have implemented when developing 
108
retention strategies.” Findings from this study indicated that the most effective strategies
are: (a) communication, which aligned with research by Iyer and Israel (2012); (b)
supporting employee development as argued by Latukha (2011); and (c) screening during
the selection and recruitment process as found by Johnson (2014).
Table 4 displays the core themes that emerged from the data analysis regarding
the most effective strategies that improve the retention of hospitality employees in the
three hospitality organizations included in this study. Retention strategies that emerged
from the data analysis include (a) communication, (b) supporting employee development,
and (c) recruiting and selecting the best employees for an organization. The frequency of
occurrence of core themes demonstrated the most effective strategies for retaining
employees (see Table 4). Thus, the findings from this study align with previous research
on employee retention.

Retention
Note: n=frequency
Recruitment. Most companies provide their management with policy manuals
and Handbooks that strictly define legal hiring practices as well as consistent policies and
processes for boosting employee retention (Deery & Jago, 2015; Valetine, 2011). P3

stated that company management training and manuals provided managers with
hypothetical circumstances with carefully written rules, policies, and practices when
interviewing and terminating employees. Inadequacies in the workplace have accelerated
the rate of employee turnover (Das, 2012). Hamnett and Bake (2012) claimed, if
managers become more selective during the employee recruitment process, companies
will not change jobs as often, which will create stable workforces.
Participants agreed that employee turnover is expensive, but if managers are
proactive during the hiring interview, they will minimize turnover (P2, P3). To have an
extremely motivated team and appeal to prospective employees, Maslow (1943), Alderfer
(1969), and Vroom (1964) proposed that managers should take steps to ensure that
employees' motivation needs are being met. Johnson’s (2014) findings indicated that
managers needed to recruit and select the right person to boost retention within a business
organization. P2 proclaimed their relationship with subordinates could positively or
negatively affect recruitment and retention efforts in multiple ways. C3 frequently scans
their workforce through exit interviews to evaluate recruiting and retention practices to
improve employee retention (Employee Handbook, January 2015).
Promoting communication. Adopting an approach from Maslow (1943) and
Alderfer (1969) enables managers to satisfy employee relatedness needs by promoting
good interpersonal relations and by providing accurate feedback. The basic tenet, as P1
and P3 noted, is that management should work on the principle that a leader can prove
their legitimacy by developing sincere relationships with their subordinates and giving
importance to their input. Managers that encourage an operation culture that involves or 
110
grants employee decision-making leverage can see increases in employee retention within
a business organization (Keeling, McGoldrick, & Sadhu, 2013).
Research summarized in the literature review provided practical measures to
improve employee retention through the promotion of managers communicating with
employee and building relationships. Abdullah and Antony (2012) posited that leaders
should share information, especially in an industry where workers tend to have a certain
level of perception about the leadership. P2 proclaimed that 85% of his day is spent
communicating with employees, so they know where we are in terms of achieving the
team goals. In a review of the C2 Employee Handbook, I triangulated with the interview
data by noting that communication with employees promotes motivation by advising and
clarifying to employees about the task to be done (Employee Handbook, June 2014). C1
and C2 Employee Handbooks suggested that managers should communicate with
employees on a continuous basis to provide employees with performance feedback and
how to improve their performance if it is insufficient (Employee Handbook, June 2014;
Employee Handbook March 2015).
Supporting employee development. Employee growth needs relate to their need
for self-development (Alderfer, 1969; Maslow, 1943). When managers allow workers to
improve their skills and abilities continuously through the engagement of supporting
meaningful work, their growth needs are being met (Alderfer, 1969). C1, C2, and C3
newsletters indicated how their companies’ workplace atmosphere is dedicated to raising
hospitality to a new level (Company newsletters, June 2015). Maslow (1943) indicated
that effective managers support and inspire employees to help motivate those employees 
111
to achieve their desired wishes.
P3 stated that on many occasions employees express their desire to grow beyond
the position for which they were hired to fill. P1 stated employees are encouraged to
consider job-enriching opportunities to meet personal goals during the employee
evaluation. Retaining employees requires more than motivation; employee retention
necessitates management adaptation to seek opportunities to help employees reach their
aspirations for growth (Latukha, 2011). P3 commented, “As the manager, I try extremely
hard to acknowledge the hard work that my employees devote to C3 Company.” P1 and
P3 claimed that employee development opportunities allow employees to showcase skills
and existing knowledge. The C1 Employee Handbook indicated C1 created work
environments where employees can achieve their full potential and, in doing so, directly
impact the growth and success of the hotel. Developmental opportunities presented to
employees can be of great value to employees who seek to grow professionally within an
organization (Kandampully et al., 2014). P1 suggested that by using employee
developmental opportunities establishes a stronger management-employee relationship.
Galletta et al. (2011) indicated that an employee’s personal motivation leads to their
ability development, which is essential in the hospitality industry.
C1 and C3 company retention policies proposed that meeting employees' needs
and motivations are taken seriously because they affect the internal work environment.
P2 and P3 mentioned that when they noticed an employee who seems unmotivated, they
took immediate action to implement strategies to ignite the motivation in those workers.
C2 Employee Handbook (June 2014) and the retention policy from C3 validated these 
112
strategies. In fact, the C3 retention policy emphasized that managers use retention
strategies outside of offering a financial reward but instead utilize individual factors such
as personality, skills, knowledge, experience, and individual abilities. Vroom (1964)
concluded that effort, performance, and motivation are linked in a person's motivation
effort.
Emergent Theme Four: Least Effective Strategies for Improving Hospitality
Employee Retention.
Retaining and motivating employees are significant factors within any organization
(Gupta & Shaw, 2014). P2 and P3 proclaimed counterproductive retention strategies
occur at some point in hospitality managers' careers. Table 5 displays the core themes
that emerged from the data analysis regarding employee retention strategies that were
least effective for improving the retention of hospitality employees in the three hospitality
organizations included in this study. Retention strategies that emerged from the data
analysis included negotiation and compensation. The frequency of occurrence of core
themes demonstrated these two strategies were the least effective for employee retention.
Table 5
Frequency of Themes Least Effective Strategies for Improving the Retention of
Hospitality Employees
Theme n % of frequency of occurrence
Negotiating 2 50%
Compensation 2 50%
Note: n=frequency
113
Negotiation. One retention strategy that some managers use in situations where
the desired outcome is for both parties to win is a negotiation (Whyman & Petrescu,
2014; Wieseke, Alavi, & Habel, 2014). Tavitiyaman et al. (2012) found that evidence that
effective employee retention strategies and aligned organizational structure can explain
positive hospitality organization performance. P1 specified that negotiating with
employees is not effective in retaining employees. "The hospitality industry is
competitive, and managers constantly seek ways to embrace the change industry demands
and employee turnover without compromising our brand quality,” proclaimed P3. The
workplace environment should consist of employees who fully embrace change (Hamnett
& Baker, 2012). P1 and P3 indicated that negotiating with employees has a negative
effect on employee retention. Based on a review of the all the company retention
documentation, no information validated the P1 and P3 claim regarding negotiating
practices with employees nor the use of negotiation as a retention strategy. In my
reflexive journal, I noted managers must understand why their employees are leaving and
take corrective actions to increase retention without compromising the operational
productivity goals (Reflexive Journal, July 2015).
Compensation. Torres and Alder (2012) proposed that companies developed
compensation strategies beyond tangible rewards such as pay to align with the business
strategy. P2 and P3 suggested offering employee’s more money is not always an option.
To influence employee retention, managers attempt to encourage workers to perform at a
higher level and be more satisfied with their work. Compensation such as flexible
schedules and professional development courses are valuable to some employees (P2). P3 
114
stated, “Offering a flexible schedule has worked in the past when I could not provide an
employee more money.”
While compensation was used to solve numerous retention strategies in the past as
proposed by P2, it is no longer as effective as it once was (P2, P3). Abii et al. (2013) also
claimed that compensation is not the only factor in retaining employees. All of the
participants agreed that compensation was a small part of a larger negotiation process for
some employees striving to fulfill their self-actualization needs. In a review of all three of
the companies’ retention documents, I noted the utilization of employee discounts could
be a form of compensation as a form of compensation (Employee Handbook, March
2015). Employee discounts for the friends and family stay program at participating
properties was a strategy used to entice employee interest by getting them consider the
discount based on compensation value (Company Newsletter, June 2015). Furthermore,
Ezulika (2012) stated individuals would take a decrease in pay for flexible working
hours. Based on the literature review, compensation could have adverse influences on
employee retention if compensation is not a motivation of an employee (Gupta & Shaw,
2014). In my reflexive journal, I noted that letting employees know they are appreciated
and their efforts are noticed builds a bond of trust and respect that enchances enhancing
loyalty, commitment, and engagement, which outweighs compensation in some instances
(Reflective Journal Entry, January 2015).
P2 and P3 agreed that compensation could be one motivating factor. P3 proposed
that offering training to make employees eligible for promotion was a valid retention
strategy. According to Vroom’s (1964) research, the association between performance 
115
and outcomes, such as pay must be high for motivation to be high. Having an
understanding of the effectiveness of a strategy may contribute toward the
implementation of a more effective strategy instead of a less effective strategy for
improving employee retention. Cardy and Legnick-Hall (2011) found that a manager’s
employee retention strategies could influence an employee’s desire to stay with the
organization for a longer period. In a review of all the company retention documents, I
found nothing that validated the participants’ claim that compensation was a least
effective retention strategy.
Summary
In general, the research findings included association with the purpose,
significance of the study, the review of the literature, and the conceptual frameworks. The
themes, shown in Tables 3, 4, 5, and 6, provided strategies that managers can use to help
improve employee retention in their hospitality organizations. The principals of employee
retention require business leaders to promote organizational policies and practices that
encourage workers to remain with the organization (James & Mathew, 2012; Ratna &
Chawla, 2012). The participants’ responses and the companies’ employee retention
documents helped me to understand the research phenomenon and determine the relative
effectiveness of strategies managers need to improve employee retention. Ping et al.
(2012) pointed out that whatever strategic approach hospitality leaders take to solve
organization challenges should include improvements to increase employee retention.
Applications to Professional Practice
The purpose of this qualitative multiple case study was to explore the strategies 
116
hospitality managers need to improve employee retention. Based on the research question
and analysis of interview responses as well as company documents, I identified four main
themes: (a) the motivational outcome; (b) leadership characteristics; (c) most effective
retention strategies; and (d) the least effective strategies influencing employee retention.
The findings from this study support the idea that Maslow's (1943), Alderfer’s (1969),
and Vroom’s (1964) theories are important theories for guiding the development of
employee retention strategies for managers in the hospitality industry. Hospitality
manager and their organizations used intrinsic and extrinsic motivational drivers essential
to improving employee retention in their organization (Shore, 2013). Based on the
finding from this research, I found that not all hospitality organizations attract similarly
motivated employees nor lead to the equivalent retention outcome. Managers
understanding of what motivates or fails to motivate employees can result in effective
retention employee strategies (Caruthers, 2011). Understanding strategies that improve
employee retention can lead to the establishment of an engaging and satisfying work
environment (Belbin, Erwee, & Wiesner, 2012; Houlfort et al., 2015). Members of
management need to monitor the main reasons employees leave a business and analyze
why an individual may have resigned from their role, which may provide valuable
feedback to improve employee retention. Developing an understanding of what strategies
improve employee retention is one of the leading challenges that plague organizational
leaders in the competitive business industry (Meléndez, Borges-Mendez, Visser, &
Rosofsky, 2015).
Organizational leaders in the 21st century need to implement retention strategies 
117
to manage employee retention and attract quality employees into the organization
(Bassey, 2012; Morley, Scullion, Collings, & Schuler, 2015). Organizations that lack
qualified workers that are good at their assigned jobs find their organization in serious
trouble (Winkler, Busch, Clasen, & Vowinkel, 2015).
Jennex (2014) argued that the cost of replacing knowledgeable workers can reach
up to 100% of that employee's annual salary. In the end, the retention of existing
employees represents a significant opportunity for saving businesses operating costs
(Jennex, 2014). Uncertainty associated with which employee retention strategies are the
most effective because of changing consumer demand is one of the major challenges
some managers face (Wiesek et al., 2014). The incurred cost of losing an employee is
dependent on the demand for a skilled employee in the workplace (Bilau, Ajagbe,
Sholanke, & Sani, 2015). Other costs related to the loss of employees include advertising
and recruiting expenses, orientation, training of the new employees, and decreased
productivity until new employees become trained (Zopiatis, Constanti, & Theocharous,
2014). These are reasons why the retention of employees is imperative to some
businesses. Once a manager hires talented employees, retention of those qualified
employees is important to maintain a reasonable return on investment (Campbell, Ganco,
Franco, & Agarwal, 2012; Shacklock & Brunetto, 2012).
Employee retention remains low in the hospitality industry resulting in one of the
most problematic management topics among manager in the industry (Kim, 2014).
Brown, Thomas, and Bosselman (2015) noted that this outcome is because of the relative
ease for entry-level employees to obtain similar jobs with competitive organizations, as 
118
jobs are often highly substitutable in terms of compensation, working conditions, and
location. Managers who implemented retention strategies to improve employee retention
and attract quality employees in their organizations include awareness of the need to
develop a skill for listening, respecting, and understanding their employees' concerns
(Twigg & McCullough, 2014). Employee departures from an organization are inevitable
(Shipp, Furst-Holloway, Harris, & Rosen, 2014; Zopiatis et al., 2014). However,
managers having a planned employee retention strategy in place mitigates the intention of
an employee to leave an organization as well as the costs associated with that departure
(Deery & Jago, 2015).
Implications for Social Change
Business organizations differ based on services, products, and sizes. Those
differences often distinguish individual businesses from their competitors. However, one
factor common to most business organizations is their success is highly reliant on the
skills, knowledge, and experience of their employees (Kinnie & Swart, 2012). Business
leaders and stakeholders could utilize the finding of this study to develop an increased
understanding of effectively developing and implementing retention strategies needed to
retain employees in all sectors of the hospitality industry.
Improving employee retention is more than retaining talent or providing an
occasional reward or a nomination for an employee of the month award (Kinnie & Swart,
2012). Business leaders who believe there is no longer relevant cause for concern
regarding the impact of employee retention often miss the deeper implications of
employee retention and lack an understanding of how retaining employees is a beneficial 
119
contribution to the stability of the economy. Increasing the retention of employees is
complex. According to Stirpe et al. (2014), many times business leaders lack an
understanding of how employee retention can negatively influence their organization’s
productivity and profit margins.
Considering the three theories of motivation discussed in this study together can
help managers gain a rich understanding of the many challenges involved in motivating
employees to remain with their organizations. Managers who examine the importance of
motivation theory, expectancy theory, and motivational needs theories can gain a better
insight regarding how to effectively motivate employees. The theories are
complementary in that each focuses on a somewhat different aspect of motivation.
Organizational leaders need to understand the motivation, what employees want from
their jobs, and why leaders need to address the needs of the employees to remain
effective and achieve company goals.
Implications for positive social change include the use of management
implemented strategic retention strategies to improve organizational responsiveness and
employee morale. The use of effective retention strategies may lead to (a) a decline in
employee retention challenges; (b) a stabilized workforce; (c) improvements in services
offered to customers; (d) an increase in employee morale; and (e) organizational and
economic amplification. Practical implications are that business leaders can use this study
to continue working toward the development of effective strategies for employee
retention. The development of retention strategies can lead to policies and practices
within their organization to improve employee retention, manager-employee working 
120
relations, and subsequently increase employee motivation, loyalty, and commitment.
Social implications are effective employee retention strategies can increase a
corporation’s image among their current and prospective workers as well as numerous
other stakeholders within the community where the organization contributes to the local
economy.
Recommendations for Action
Researchers have completed a plethora of studies on the topic of employee
retention strategies (Mitchell et al., 2014). The continuous growth of the hospitality
industry in Florida since 2008 stimulated business leaders to focus on a more employeecentered work environment to increase the retention of their employees. Employee
retention is moderate in hospitality organizations in Brevard County, Florida.
Experienced employees have a small number of opportunities to choose for employment,
which stimulates each organization to compete with the others in continuously
developing retention strategies to retain their workforce and to attract qualified
prospective employees. The findings from this study are important to hospitality
managers, HR managers, business leaders, and management professionals. The
application of effective employee retention strategies may assist managers in successfully
retaining employees and sustaining profitability.
Business leaders should view employee retention as a serious problem and
implement proactive measures to improve retention by involving managers who have
experience in developing effective employee retention strategies. Forums or professional
conferences are ideal opportunities for hospitality managers to provide feedback openly. 
121
Hospitality managers can provide feedback on various industry issues such as how low
employee retention can threaten or influence an organization’s performance.
The basis for developing retention strategies is sometimes the outcome. The aim
of most managers is to increase productivity and efficiency to reach maximum results for
the organization. Hospitality management professionals should consider the results of this
study to design retention strategies and improve employee retention in their
organizations. Furthermore, the changing U.S. economy, as well as the supply of and
demand for workers necessitate reviews of existing retention strategies by managers and
the adoption of new initiatives that are based on the results of this study.
Periodically monitoring and tracking employee retention strategies of an
organization and its competitors can be useful in planning and implementing effective
employee retention strategies. The business leader who understands employee motivation
can plan proactive measures towards developing and implementing effective employee
retention strategies. Business leaders can disseminate employee surveys and conduct exit
interviews with departing employees to develop a better understanding of the changing
expectations of their employees over time.
I will share my study findings with other business professionals through scholarly
journals and other business publications. Also, I will share the findings through seminars
and training courses on employee retention strategies. My focus will be on helping
organization leaders improve employee retention in their organizations.
Recommendations for Further Research
Employee retention is a phenomenon that continues to affect multiple industries. 
122
Exploring strategies that hospitality managers need to improve employee retention led to
the identification of several emerging themes that warrant further study. The themes
identified may help industry leaders develop strategies to improve employee retention in
the workplace and reduce the associated loss of customer satisfaction, employee
productivity, and organization profitability. Workers have more needs that motivate them
than those described by Maslow (1943), Alderfer (1969), and Vroom (1964). Researchers
can investigate the three themes identified in this study. These include (a) factors
influencing employee turnover, (b) HR management recruiting strategies aimed at
identifying highly qualified candidates, and (c) the influence of leadership styles on a
multigenerational workforce.
Additionally, researchers should conduct further studies to explore employee
retention strategies not identified or covered in this study, which should help to address
the limitations identified in this study. The retention strategies identified in this study
merit investigation from the viewpoints of employees. Furthermore, since this study
focused on the area of Brevard County, Florida, I recommend further research on the
retention strategies used by hospitality managers in other geographic locations using a
larger study population.
Reflections
The Walden University Doctor Business Administration (DBA) Program has been
an interesting and rewarding experience. At the beginning of my matriculation in the
program, I was very enthusiastic to embark on a new challenge. I met some great
colleagues and professors within a short time who have remained with me through the 
123
end of my research journey. However, as time progressed in the development of my
study, I often felt overwhelmed and dispirited. The encouragement of colleagues,
mentors, and my chair, and the many program directors helped me to remain engaged in
my studies. Finding a group of colleagues who had the same amount of drive aided me in
overcoming the feeling of being overwhelmed and frustrated.
The phenomenon of employee retention is a personal and professional interest of
mine since I finished my undergraduate studies. I have an active interest in the subject. In
my study process, I researched top challenges in the business industry, and employee
retention was among those on the list. From my review of the academic and professional
literature, I began to focus my interest on information that related to employee retention,
employee turnover, and employee retention strategies.
At the beginning of my study, I wanted to explore real-life experiences regarding
employee retention. The original topic was strategies for retaining top-performing
employees in the hospitality industry; however, effective employee retention strategies
implemented by managers became clearer through a narrower research approach. I
changed the title of my research to Strategies for Retaining Employees in the Hospitality
Industry. I chose a qualitative multiple case study research design to compare the
retention strategies some managers are using to improve employee retention in a
constantly changing workforce. The three study participants provided key insights into
employee retention strategies, which answered my personal and study research question.
The findings of this study affect me personally as a small to midsize business
consultant professional. As a business consultant, I am aware of the dissimilar 
124
perspectives that managers and subordinates have on the subject of employee retention
strategies and how a lack of employee motivation negatively affects an operation’s
productivity. Effective managers, such as those interviewed, tend to follow many
motivational guidelines to retain employees, whereas ineffective managers often fail to
follow them and seem to have difficulty motivating and retaining employees.
Although differences existed in the participants' perspectives, I identified many
similarities that all faced as they searched for ways to improve employee retention. The
findings of the study were similar to my experiences in attempting to create, improve, and
change employee retention strategies in many of my clients’ businesses. While some of
the study participants use similar strategies, there were also some differences. As a result,
the findings from this study could be used by business professionals to understand
employee retention strategies that motivate employees without compromising operational
efficiency.
Summary and Study Conclusions
Hospitality organizations need to consider employee motivation to improve
retention; employees tend to stay where they feel welcome (Belbin et al., 2012). The
purpose of this qualitative multiple case study was to answer the central research
question, what strategies do hospitality managers need to improve employee retention. As
such, managers create environments that may either encourage or inhibit an employee’s
desire to remain within an organization (Tsai, Horng, Liu, & Hu, 2015). Management
must use the proper incentives to achieve the desired results of improving employee
retention in their organizations (Karahanna, 2015). The success of an organization 
125
depends on improving retention, which an organization achieves by implementing
motivational theories such as those by Maslow (1943), Alderfer (1969), and Vroom
(1964). Each of the theories of motivation discussed in this study focused on one or more
issues that managers need to address to motivate their employees. Together these theories
provide a comprehensive set of guidelines for managers to follow to improve employee
retention in their organizations.
Although limited to a narrow set of retention strategies, the results of the study
include findings that such strategies have the potential to influence the satisfaction of the
employee’s motivation. Employee motivation is critical for achieving desired
organizational level outcomes of employee retention initiatives (Belbin et al., 2012). The
study participants and the documents of the companies demonstrated the importance of
carefully considering employee motivations during the design of retention strategies.
The importance of retention strategies among business process configurations was
highlighted in this study. An additional contribution of this study is the illustration of
how employee retention strategies can influence specific business procedures used to
gain insight into the motivational effects of some commonly implemented retention
strategies. Also, the study approach provides a foundation for many organizations already
using several of the strategies identified, but may be lacking, deficient, or uncertain
regarding which strategies improve their employee retention. Knowledge regarding
which employee retention strategies are effective is critical to the overall success of an
employee retention plan (Ping et al., 2012). 
126
In conclusion, improving employee retention is among the priorities for
businesses. These initiatives may influence the motivation of organizational members.
Employee development is not just the responsibility of the employee. Kachalla (2014)
stated that after 50 years of research employee motivation continues to be one of the
problems and challenges facing organizations. Organizations continually seek new
solutions to assess, understand, and strategize employee retention (Supanti, Butcher, &
Fredline, 2015).
Keeping employees motivated is the key to a successful and productive workforce
(Bassey, 2012). Managers must find ways to understand what drives employees within
the context of their role in the organization (Elloy, 2012). Retention strategies are
designed in such a way that the employees' motivations are an investment in their worth
and contribute to powerful incentives to remain with the organization.

Employers, It’s Time to Talk About Infertility

It’s 7:00 in the morning, and the nurse struggles to find Sarah’s vein to take her blood. Sarah’s arms are bruised; she’s been coming to the clinic for nine days in a row for morning bloodwork. She’s in the fourth year of her treatment and has no idea when it will end.

Sarah doesn’t have cancer or terminal illness — she’s trying to have a baby. When she started her treatment, she expected it to work quickly. She didn’t feel comfortable telling her boss, was careful not to overload herself with stressful work, and didn’t apply when a better position opened up in her department; she was focused on her care.

Sarah’s case is no exception. A growing number of couples are experiencing infertility, with around one in six seeking treatment. Despite this, most companies’ policies and initiatives focus on those who have had success in their family-planning journeys and on issues like duration of parental leave, post-leave integration, and work-life balance. While pregnancy and childbirth are highly visible and often celebrated, fertility challenges tend to be invisible and silent. For many couples, it’s an incredibly personal and sometimes painful experience, and one that’s difficult to share even with close friends and family. Discussing it with coworkers and bosses can feel like a window into the most intimate parts of your life. (As Carolynn Dubé from Fertility Matters puts it, “Infertility takes people into the bedroom.”)

Many women hesitate to share their infertility struggles because of concerns about its impact on their careers. According to a survey from Fertility Network UK, 50% of women did not disclose their treatment to their employer out of fear that the employer wouldn’t take them seriously and over 40% due to concerns about its negative effects on their career prospects.

Lengthy fertility treatments can have serious emotional, physical, and financial impacts on a woman and her partner. There are several actions leaders can take to understand these impacts and to foster an environment of support and inclusion. Organizations that enable employees to prosper in their careers through various life chapters will be able to attract and retain experienced and high-potential employees.

The Infertility Journey
Categorized as a disease by WHO, infertility is the inability of a sexually active, non-contraceptive couple to achieve pregnancy in one year. Treatments can involve a combination of heavy hormonal therapies, daily injections at home, frequent and unpredictable early morning visits to the clinic for bloodwork and ultrasounds, or surgery. While some couples achieve a healthy pregnancy within a few months, for many, the process lasts for years. Male-related factors contribute to about 35% of cases, but in the large majority of cases, it’s necessary for the woman to undergo treatment. This article focuses on women’s experience while recognizing that men share some of these challenges and may benefit from our suggestions as well.
Women in their 40s are now the only age group with a rising pregnancy rate. With growing competition in the job market, the early years of career-building can involve longer work hours, more time spent traveling for work, and getting more education. For women, this time often overlaps with the prime years of childbearing. Some women feel they face an either-or choice: Build a career or have children. For a growing number of women, delaying motherhood until their careers are well established feels like the right decision. While this delayed family planning works for many, the inconvenient truth is that women’s fertility sharply declines after the age of 35. For those women who want children, their likelihood of needing fertility treatments increases with age, yet the success rate decreases, often resulting in lengthy treatments.

As treatment lengthens, the combination of physical side effects and the stress of failed treatments month after month can be detrimental to a woman’s emotional health. The financial cost of the procedures further disrupts a family: Fertility IQ puts the average cost of successful IVF treatment at about $50,000. To complicate the situation even more, these challenges can also harm a woman’s relationship with her partner. Research shows that couples who go through unsuccessful fertility treatments are three times more likely to divorce or end cohabitation. It’s not surprising that approximately half of women experiencing infertility rated it as the most stressful experience in their life, and 61% rated it as more stressful than divorce.

Infertility and Work: A Silent Experience
Research shows that experiencing infertility can have a tremendous impact on the daily life and professional roles of women. Going through it in silence precludes women from receiving support from their employers throughout the process. Through our own experiences and in talking to women who have undergone fertility treatments, we’ve found the following work-related side effects especially problematic:
Making appointments work. Treatment commitments can become so frequent that it can feel impossible to manage trips to the clinic and continue working. Appointments are time consuming and unpredictable and often require recovery time, adding stress to an already overwhelming process. If life and work are not modified to create space for this new stressor, the setting can quickly lead to burnout and potentially depression, pushing a woman into a vicious cycle of stress, reduced performance, and reduced fertility prospects.

Loss of support. In some cases, the physical and emotional challenges of treatment inhibit a woman from performing at her best. Taking time off, missing out on important meetings, and struggling to stay on top of work can be interpreted by employers or colleagues as slacking or lack of motivation. This can result in poor performance evaluations and being passed over for promotions or new opportunities.

Holding back. Many women make changes to their lifestyles to avoid stress, which is linked to lower chances of pregnancy. Some women may leave a stressful role for one that’s more manageable alongside demanding treatments. In anticipation of a soon-to-come pregnancy, some women put their careers on hold and don’t apply for promotions, better positions, or new projects.

Infertility-Informed Leadership
Leaders and HR managers who are unaware of an employee’s challenges are in the dark when assessing her ambitions or evaluating her performance, leaving the employee at a disadvantage and stifling efforts focused on diversity and retention. Unless employees know they will be supported, they will be reluctant to disclose their personal situations. If you’re in a position to create or influence company policies, consider the following actions to ensure you’re supporting your employees as they go through fertility treatments:

Give voice to the silence. Recognize that infertility is a normal aspect of our lives and discuss it openly; don’t hold back from using terms such as “infertility,” “IVF,” or “miscarriage.” Normalizing the conversation around fertility can be an important step in moving out of the silence and creating an environment where women feel supported to share their treatment and career plans with their employer.

Create infertility-informed policies. Despite infertility being designated a chronic illness, most employer benefit plans do not cover its treatment. This means employees may not be able to use sick leave or any of the other support mechanisms available to people experiencing other chronic illnesses. Creating a fertility policy that covers benefits such as time off pre-conception, reduced hours and duties, counseling, and financial support can help employees navigate the challenges around their treatment. This can also send a strong signal that you’re a family-friendly employer, which can help attract and retain talent.

Provide guidance to managers. Educate managers about the impact of fertility treatments on work and provide guidance on potential solutions. Managers need to keep in mind that managing treatment appointments around work can be difficult, and leniency and offering employees a routine that allows them to be out of the office as they go through treatment can go a long way toward ensuring they feel supported and can better manage their work. It’s also important to understand that fertility treatments can necessitate sick leave.

Offer flexibility in career planning. Infertility is an idiosyncratic experience. While some women may choose to move to less-stressful positions during treatment, others may prefer to seek challenging opportunities in anticipation of a slower pace after pregnancy or as a positive emotional offset to the struggles of infertility. The former benefits from programs that will help her get back on track when she’s ready, whereas the latter appreciates the support to freely pursue her ambitions despite her unpredictable life setting. Flexibility in career planning allows both to prosper.

Although a significant and growing number of families are grappling with fertility issues, most companies’ policies aren’t designed with those issues in mind. Companies that work to support employees in this phase of family planning will attract and retain good talent and bolster inclusion efforts. As Verna Myers puts it, “Diversity is being invited to the party; inclusion is being asked to dance.” It’s time for business leaders to understand and accommodate this challenge and allow more people the opportunity to dance.

Employee Retention: Big Company Tactics for Small Businesses
Employee Retention: Big Company Tactics for Small Businesses
By: Emily Bennington, Monster Contributing Writer

First, the bad news about employee retention. According to a recent Monster study on employee loyalty, 82% of surveyed employees have updated their resume in the past six months. Moreover, a whopping 59% say they are looking for a job “all the time.”

This crisis in employee retention is obviously a huge headache for employers who need to keep A-players in place to achieve business goals. (If you’re constantly recruiting and training new hires, that’s time spent away from your customers, right? Not good.)

The pressure is even greater for small businesses, which often compete for talent against larger organizations with more resources to lure them away. This begs the question: What are they doing you’re not?

Certainly employee compensation is a factor — but when it comes to keeping staff loyal — the real power lies in employee engagement.

Often, the level of investment an employee makes in your business is directly proportional to how much you’re willing to invest in them. This is where small businesses can take a page from “big company” playbooks and implement programs that are proven to increase overall employee retention rates. Here are a few of the best for your consideration:

Leadership Academies
Will Sutton, Executive Vice-President of BB&T, credits the bank’s internal Leadership Development Program for significantly boosting employee retention rates. “We studied retention levels over a five year period and found that — for graduates of the Leadership Development Program — the rate was 76%.” Notably, Sutton says this is 45% higher than the average retention rate for new employees who do not come through the program.

Once participants are accepted, they commit to full-time learning for ten months at BB&T University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. “The curriculum is broken down into four phases,” says Sutton. “In the first phase we work on developing leadership skills and banking knowledge.”

The second phase includes core competencies where participants learn more about their specific program track — commercial, retail, or corporate. “We use the third phase to really drill down into the skills needed to succeed in each track; in the fourth phase, all participants are brought together again and given the opportunity to run their own bank through an online simulation.”

While the Leadership Development Program represents a considerable up-front investment in new staff, Sutton believes it’s worth it, especially when compared to the cost of high turnover. “Pay now,” he says, “or pay later.”

Formal Mentoring Programs
Sodexo is another organization seeing real bottom-line employee retention benefits that come from staff development. The food and facilities giant offers a mentoring program that Jodi Davidson, Director of Diversity & Inclusion Initiatives, says reaps a 2-to-1 return on investment.

“Our studies show that for every one dollar we invest in the program, we get two dollars back in things like reduced turnover, increased productivity, increased customer satisfaction, and more efficient management overall.”

Davidson says a big key to the program’s success is the support provided by Sodexo’s mentoring implementation team. “We check-in with each pairing at the two month mark just to see how things are going,” she says. “If it’s what we call a ‘red-flag’, the team will step in with additional coaching and a bit more follow-up.”

If the relationship is progressing and set goals are being met, the mentoring implementation team will reach out again with email surveys at six months, twelve months, and six months after the program is complete.

Sodexo also hosts webinars at the four and eight month mark for additional training on communication and strategic leadership. “The Spirit of Mentoring program provides both professional and personal development for our employees,” says Davidson.

“Mentees are achieving their goals and gaining self-confidence, while mentors are honing their communication and leadership skills, and have the opportunity to ‘give back’.”

Internal Recognition
If creating a full-scale development program is more than you’re willing to tackle at the moment, an easier tactic may be to simply recognize your professionals for a job well done.

Paul Hebert, Managing Director of incentive design consultancy I2I, says internal recognition is among the best ways to give employee engagement a boost.

“When employees feel recognized by their employer, studies show they are more satisfied in their jobs.” Hebert also says recognition is “an action, not an item,” meaning you don’t need to invest in any fancy awards or hardware. You simply encourage everyone in your organization to “catch” their peers doing something right.

“The best recognition programs aren’t really ‘programs’ at all,” he says. “There’s no start or end date, only the act of saying to someone — in front of other people — ‘you did good.’” In other words, this is one area where small companies can play “big” indeed.
