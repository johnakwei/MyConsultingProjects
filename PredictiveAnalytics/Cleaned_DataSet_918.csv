My mortgage at the time was through XXXX and I was on an excelerated payment schedule, I also made a monthly payment towards the premium. In XXXX XXXX, my mortgage was sold to Chase Bank, I was unable to make payment online AFTER scheduling autopay which was never deducted from my account, I fell behind by 2 month in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX- I made a double payment in XX/XX/XXXX and scheduled an additional double payment for XX/XX/XXXX My XX/XX/XXXX payment came out of my account but the XXXX XXXX payment did not. XX/XX/XXXX, I requested a mortgage modification, I made the trial payments, sent in the paperwork ( I was not nor did this modification LOWER my payments- I just wanted my mortgage to be back on track ). In XXXX XXXX I received notice that my house was in foreclosure. I was told there was an issue with the signature date being different from the notary. I had to reapply for the modification, I started a NEW trial period. Made all my payments- received the paperwork to be notarized at the same time I received another foreclosure notice due to my trial payment 'failing '. I had completed all payments. XXXX XXXX I complete ANOTHER modification agreement and begin my trial period of payments. The 3rd month in- they refund my check stating I paid 'too early ' ( 9 days early ). I resent the payment - which is now 5 days late due to not being aware that although they took the money from my account- they were not applying it to my payment. I receive another final paperwork to be notarized, I send in all the paperwork. On XXXX XXXX, I receive a letter from Chase stating there was a signature missing and I have to AGAIN fill out the paperwork, have notarized, and mail back. On XXXX XXXX, it came to my attention that Chase had AGAIN filed foreclosure on my home. This is a SCAM. I have sent in what they have asked- there is no reason that after THREE times of this and their vague excuses of what is going on is infuriating! I owed XXXX on my home when Chase bought out my mortgage- now, due to 'fees ', etc- I owe XXXX. They have no interest in helping and I was told by the law firm representing Chase that I should 'file for bankruptcy '. The only debot I have is MY MORTGAGE- my credit card balances have never exceeded XXXX and I pay them off once a year- all of my other bills are current. This is insane and unfair to homeowners without a team of lawyers as Chase has. This is MY HOME- I did not have a problem the first 3 years with my other lender. I have jumped through hoops to do what they asked of me and I have nowhere else to go.","Other","JPMorgan Chase & Co.","PA","185XX","Other","Consent provided","Web","11/23/2016","Closed with explanation","Yes","No",2220602

Nationstar Mortgage is my current lender and they raised my mortgage payment by {$300.00} dollars, without notifying me of the increase because of an escrow shortage. I called Nationstar to make arrangements or determine what my options were. They had began the foreclosure process. At that time, I began to go through the modification process with Nationstar. I submitted paperwork after paperwork, only to be told several times that they did not have the documents. I submitted the same document over 5 times, as they repeatedly told me they did not have it. At that point, I began to get nervous because I read that this is a standard practice of Nationstar to stall its consumers. I had been assigned to a loan specialist, XXXX XXXX, who I understand is the lead loan manager at Nationstar. I would call Nationstar to follow up with him, but it always went to his voicemail, and I would have speak with other agents, who appeared to be incompetent and unhelpful. After weeks of trying to get all the documents to underwriting, it finally made it with a daunting foreclosure sale date XX/XX/XXXX. Nationstar informed me that the modification would postpone the sale date. I was advised that it would take 20 to 30 days for the process. My documents were in to underwriting on XX/XX/XXXX. I called to inquire when I would receive disclosures forms, because I have no idea what type of modification I was applying for or the terms. The rep on the phone stated 3 to 5 days. I did not receive any disclosure forms but I received a copy of my credit report along with the coborrower. I called Nationstar, to request the status of the modification and when I should expect to receive my disclosure forms. The Nationstar rep informed me that I have been denied for all the modification available because I did not occupy the home. What??? I have lived in my home for over 8 years. Mind you, I have called Nationstar over a 100 times during this process and this is one of their verification questions. My answer has been the same each time. Yes, the home is owner occupied with me! The Nationstar rep informed me that I would have to wait to get my denial letter to appeal. I could not understand this and I refused to get off the phone until the matter was escalated. After an hour on the phone, my dedicated loan specialist, XXXX XXXX joined the call and apologized for the mix up and stated that he would work with underwriting to resubmit. He stated that he would walk it over personally. I am nervous because I feel like I am getting the run around and Nationstar is going to take my house from me by giving me the runaround. The horror stories and reviews are awful from consumers going through this process with Nationstar. As a consumer, this type of treatment and lack of competency on Nationstar staff is unacceptable. I am just trying to save my home and get back on track.

At the completion of construction ( CO passed ), we had difficulty closing the permanent loan with First Tenn as we relayed to them several items not completed but had been paid for already by the bank. The bank 's duly designated inspector found no defects nor any issues with the construction. Closing was delayed and a second appraisal ordered by the bank. Throughout the construction, the bank colluded directly with the builder and moved money between line items without proper credits, documentation for invoices, nor sufficient communication with me. During the wait for the second appraisal, we found several construction code violations ( XXXX ), and Major Defects ( XXXX ) included in a punch list of XXXX items. The bank distanced itself, and I sought permanent loan financing elsewhere. During the search for new loan financing, the builder filed a lien on the home ( after we had taken posession of it while still working "" with '' First Tennessee, and prior to permanent loan financing ). First Tennessee then commenced a series of negligent errors costing us valuable time and damage to our credit rating including offering a "" blackmail '' version of a "" loan extension '' initially ( focused on relieving the bank of any liability due to their negligence ), followed by a series of "" after the fact '' ( back dated XXXX loan extensions with the end result of frustrating and scaring away potential permanent loan institutions due to Dodd-Frank issues and XXXX loan practices being significantly breached by First Tennessee. Certain bank VPs became harrassing and threatening during the process I was left to unravel. The end result was it took us 11 months to find a permanent loan ( VA ). During this same timeframe, the bank continued making loan errors, made up a fake agreement regarding a "" payment plan '', then engaged in false credit reporting by submitting a false supplemental credit report stating we were in default and late paying the "" fake payment plan '' XXXX fake = never spoken of by either party, nor agreed to. This according to the XXXX XXXX personally handling our account ). The bank also doled out loan extensions, always after the due date of the previous extension, AND always back-dated as if the loan had never lapsed into default, which new institutions were rightfully not willing to accept. This entire process took place due to First Tennessee negligence in accounting, project oversight, inspections, and contract practices, illegal loan extension agreements, blackmail in the form of an initial "" loan extension agreement '' who 's sole purpose was relieving the bank of liability for its illegal and unethical actions, and engaging in false credit reporting. All of this was unavoidable had the bank done its job, yet it left a huge hardship on myself and my family causing and extreme level of anxiety and stress, loss of work due to becoming XXXX, and robbed my family of the opportunity to enjoy a new and completed home. The pain and suffering was enormous. I contracted with a professional, licensed, regulated institution with professional, licensed and regulated individuals to protect both bank and my interests since I am neither licensed nor a professional in this field of expertise. I relied on them to perform their required licensed and regulated duties on my behalf, and they failed miserably to the point of negligent on their part.","Other","First Tennessee Bank","NC","286XX","Servicemember","Consent provided","Web","12/29/2016","Closed with explanation","Yes","Yes",2269047

The shortage was paid in full whilst talking with the service representative. Due to the timing of the payment ( XX/XX/2016 ), the XXXX payment would be a higher amount with the XXXX payment reverting back to the same amount prior to the escrow shortage.

I called LoanCare and we were told "" sorry you 're delinquent and have to pay. '' After I did a lot of research and digging, I identified that on XX/XX/2016 XXXX applied a payment to principal in error. I called XXXX and spoke with XXXX on XX/XX/2016 who acknowledged their error. At my request, I had XXXX call LoanCare with me on the line to find out how XXXX can get their error corrected since LoanCare is the new servicer. The representative we spoke with indicated for XXXX to email XXXX with a copy of the payment history showing their error for it to be corrected within 72 hours, which she did on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX. I called LoanCare on XX/XX/XXXX, was told it has n't been fixed yet. Called LoanCare on XX/XX/2016, was told they never received the email, called back on XX/XX/2016 and was hung up on by two different representative because I requested a manager and was told I could n't speak to one and then after 45 minutes on hold was informed that I was on the phone with a supervisor and she would research the issue and call me back - I never received a call back. I then called today and after speaking with another very rude representative, I requested a manager. I specified a manager and was transferred to XXXX who informed me that he was the Customer Service Manager. XXXX in fact is a Collections Team Lead, NOT a Customer Service Manager. XXXX was incredible rude and disrespectful on the telephone to me. After over an hour on the phone ( of which 95 % of that time I was on hold by XXXX ), XXXX disconnected me from the call. I then called back and was put into XXXX 's voicemail in which I informed him that I was filing the CFPB complaint. Later, I received a call back from XXXX, I had to re-send him the information from XXXX and was told that they would try to fix the issue. I am appalled by the level of customer service and the amount of time I have had to spend on the telephone with LoanCare to get a simple payment history error corrected. The evidence of XXXX 's error, from XXXX, has been sent to LoanCare over 3 times now and may payments are still showing delinquent. I am aware of the service transfer laws where I have 60 days until credit report and late fees are assessed, well, that 60 days is up XXXX and my payments are still incorrect. Not only have I wasted my time spending hours on the phone with LoanCare, but I 've been disrespected, talked down to, and hung up on more times than I can count.

This fee will be charged on the first business day following the statement period date. To avoid this fee, we will need to turn off paper statements through Online Banking and to do so individually for each account. The letter acknowledges that the change is easier for some than others and that this is being done for environmental reasons. We have contacted bank representatives at local branches and by phone several times indicating that this is an inconvenience for us and makes it difficult to review charges ( allowing the possibility of additional fees to go unnoticed ). We also noted the equity and access issues, particularly for individuals who do not have easy internet access. Each representative and supervisor categorically stated that they could not override the paper statement fee at an individual level. I understand that this fee applies only to our personal account, and not the business ones which shows inconsistency between accounts. It is my understanding by reviewing relevant online guidelines and reaching out to several state and federal agencies that national banks are required to provide periodic statements if electronic fund transfers can be made to or from the checking, savings, money market, or NOW account. We are concerned that the paper statement service fee represents a potentially deceptive, unfair, and inequitable banking practice and that such a charge violates our rights as consumers. We would like this issue to be investigated not only for our family as account holders, but for all account holders who may prefer to maintain paper statements at no additional fee.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","Santander Bank US","MA","021XX","Other","Consent provided","Web","12/25/2016","Closed","Yes","No",2263688

I contacted HSN and was told it was their mistake but they did n't have it in that color any longer and not sure when it would be but I could check back. I decided to return it, along with the scented disks after calling back to see if the color was available. On XXXX/XXXX/16 I used the XXXX shipping label provided by HSN for their claimed VIP Easy Return policy. I took the package to to a XXXX store and processed at XXXX. The package reached their XXXX XXXX distribution center on XXXX/XXXX/16 at XXXX and signed for by XXXX XXXX XXXX I received a bill for XXXX w/ payment due date of XXXX/XXXX/16 that did not show a return but I assumed it would take at least XXXX billing cycle to reflect it. However, when I received the XXXX bill ( payment due XXXX/XXXX/16 ) not showing the return and also a late fee charge I called Comenity Bank and was referred back to HSN to resolve it. I spoke to customer service representative XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/16. She said that the returned merchandise sometimes takes up to 6 weeks to get processed. She then suggested I make the payment and get a refund later. I said no, I was not going make a payment for something that was no longer in my possession but was in HSN 's. She agreed to give me a credit for the amount due plus late fee and said it should be resolved. I got another bill in XXXX with more charges and late fees. On XXXX/XXXX/16 I called Comenity Bank and spoke to XXXX. He said he could n't do anything about it and I would have to call HSN. I called HSN that same day and spoke with XXXX. She reversed the charges and assured me she had taken care of the issue and I should n't get billed again but it XXXX take 5 days for the bank to process XXXX checked online on or about XXXX/XXXX/16 to see if the issue was resolved as XXXX had promised. It was not so I filed a complaint with the FTC. I contacted HSN via email on XXXX to inform them of such. I exchanged several emails with XXXX & XXXX both of whom were Senior Account Supervisors. XXXX assured me that the merchandise had been returned and all charges and fees were returned. I assumed once again that it was no longer something I need to worry about or have to call again on. However, did continue to check online to see if there were any charges and of course there were. On XXXX/XXXX/16 I filed another complaint with the FTC this XXXX against Comenity Bank because the charges had not been removed. Sometime in XXXX I began to get numerous calls from a number I did not recognize. I finally called the number after so many calls and no messages. It was, to my surprise the collections department of Comenity. My account was now in collections for failure to make a payment! On XXXX/XXXX/16 I spoke with XXXX ( employee ID number XXXX ). She assured me that she would fix this issue. I told her I had no faith in that since this had been going on for so long. She was adamant that it would stop with her and she would be the XXXX to fix it at long last. Thus, I believed her and did not concern myself with any other billing statements. Around XXXX/XXXX/16 I received notification from a credit monitoring service that XXXX/HSN had reported XXXX late payments to XXXX. I filed a dispute in attempt to resolve it. On XXXX/XXXX/16 I received notification from Credit Karma that it was resolved. When I checked my credit report there was no change. I then called XXXX.

They have reviewed my finances two times in the past two years and determined based on my gross income that I can afford the monthly payment. They do not even take into account the other student loans I have or my monthly living expenses. One time I was told that I should get my co-signer to pay if I ca n't pay. When I told the customer service representative that my co-signer could not pay, then he apologized and said he could not do anything for me. I asked to speak to his supervisor and he forwarded me on to the supervisor, who told me the exact same thing. One representative asked me if I could borrow money from another person to pay my loan payment. I called multiple times prior to falling behind on my loan payments, and they refused to work with me to reduce my payments. Every time they mention a deferment, they say that I need to make a payment to bring the loan current. When I tell them that I can not make a payment, they again bring up that my co-signer should be helping me make the payment, and say there is nothing they can do until I make a payment. They have offered to put me on a deferment but I need to make XXXX consecutive payments in order to get on the deferment. When I tell them that I absolutely can not make the payment, they again say that there is nothing they can do for me. They bounce me back and forth between different departments, and when I ask to speak to their supervisors, they will sometimes transfer me to a person or someone 's voicemail, and they will tell me the same thing. They have sent numerous threatening letters and call both myself and my co-signer often daily and say in the letters and phone calls that they have tried to get a hold of me. When I call them, they tell me the same exact thing-either that I will need to make some kind of payment to be put on a deferment, or that I do not qualify for a payment reduction/change in my payment plan. Every time I ask the representative what I should do since I can not make the payment, they say I 'm sorry, there is nothing else I can do for you. I applied for a consolidation loan and they declined me, although they keep suggesting that I apply for the consolidation loan every time I talk to a representative. They refuse to work with me-they offer options and then tell me I either have to make a payment or do not qualify for the options.

They left a rather official sounding message that they were a debt collection agency and that I needed to call them back about a debt. I called them immediately and then they asked me to verify, for security reasons, who I was. They asked for my address, which I gave them ( because it 's public record ) and then the last XXXX of my social security number, which is PII and I would not give them. I asked them to disclose to me what the call was about or any details of the debt, which they would not tell me. They kept saying that I needed to disclose the last XXXX of my SSN or the conversation would be over. That 's when I told them that it would be over because I would n't share it unless they told me what the call was about, which they would not do. She kept telling me that she already had my SSN but she needed me to verify it. When I asked her how she got my SSN, she could not answer me. I advised her that only my banking and credit card institutions had my SSN and that all of those debts are up to date. To date I have received no verbal, text, or written notice that I have any unpaid debts, so I was very suspicious as to what this might be about. I checked my credit report, which showed no inquiries and no late payments within the past XXXX years as well as no public record accounts named. I asked the technician if she could explain how I was supposed to ever find out what debt I have n't paid if she would n't tell me, and she could not answer. She asked for my information again, I told her no, and then she hung up. This instance may have actually been the company that they said it was or potentially a spear phishing scam ; I 'm not sure which. I contacted our lawyer immediately who also advised me to not give my PII over the phone. Again, I have still never received anything in writing from any company or any loan agency or credit card to date, so I find it suspicious and do not feel like I should have to share my information with this company for them to tell me why they are calling me. The number they wanted me to call was XXXX, they contacted me from XXXX, and the technician 's name was XXXX.","Other","Navient Solutions, LLC.","GA","308XX","Servicemember","Consent provided","Web","5/22/2015","Closed with explanation","Yes","No",1388654

We told them over and over again what we could afford and it was never good enough, it always had to go to a VP at the company for review and some reps told us to expect a call from the VP and other reps and supervisors told us we were crazy that the VP 's never spoke with the consumer.

Started about a year ago when I suddenly started receiving a bill. I called to check on the bill and was told the bill did not need to be paid because my co-signer was filing for bankruptcy. When asked why I had not received notification of what was going on, I was told by law they did n't have to reveal anything. This all happened while the loan was building interest. I started to pay my bill and got the inflated bill caught up. Around XXXX 2015, no bill came. This continued for about 3 months. I finally was able to log into my account and found out my bill was 3 months past due. I called Navient on XXXX XXXX, 2015 to discuss the issue. They validated my mailing address and phone number. When asked why bills stops, they stated the bills were always coming and the issue was with the Postal service. When further asked why I had not received phone calls regarding late billing, the response was that the phone number was not validated. My current address has not changed in almost 5 years and current phone number has not changed in over XXXX. I spoke with a regular employee and manager. I was badged by the manager who stated, "" you know when the bill comes, just pay it. '' When continuously stating that I have not received anything regarding a bill by phone nor mail, the issue was never with the company. I asked if there was a way to correct the issue and get the late fees and penalties removed and was told no. Since this conversation, I have checked with the Postal service. Their statement was, "" why would delivery every piece of mail except XXXX? '' The employee is willing to write me a formal letter stating that they have delivered all mail. Also since my conversation with Navient, I now am receiving my bill that had quit coming for 3 months.","Other","Navient Solutions, LLC.","TN","376XX","Other","Consent provided","Web","1/14/2016","Closed with explanation","Yes","No",1742633

Since Navient found where it was incorrectly posted, Navient has made XXXX manual entries trying to post the {$2600.00} payment between XXXX of my private loans and backdate it to XXXX/XXXX/14 ( the date it was posted to the wrong student account ). The payment still has not been posted correctly after six months and XXXX entries. After numerous calls and countless hours dealing with Navient 's Customer Service ( you ca n't speak to anyone who actually posts your payments or knows how it works ), I finally found someone who would request my account be audited by Navient 's "" Finance Dept '' regarding my payments and the interest paid in 2014. I finally received XXXX separate letters from Navient for each audit ( payments and interest ). The XXXX letter said the interest I paid in 2014 was {$53.00} ( I made XXXX payments of {$210.00} each in 2014, plus the additional {$2600.00} payment ). The XXXX letter showed all of the "" payments '' in 2014 with a breakdown of how much was applied to Principal and how much to Interest. When you add up the Interest Navient showed, it totals {$3200.00}. Please explain to me how XXXX letter says interest paid in 2014 is {$53.00} and the other letter shows {$3200.00}. The letters were dated XXXX day apart. Neither letter is correct. Navient has made so many errors I do n't know if anyone can fix it, but certainly no one at Navient is capable of doing it. I am so frustrated with not being able to talk to anyone at Navient who understands Accounting and can see the errors made in the XXXX entries they have made. I am hopeful CFPB can research and reconcile my account and ensure Navient processes the correct entries to resolve this.","Other","Navient Solutions, LLC.","FL","327XX","Other","Consent provided","Web","5/21/2015","Closed with explanation","Yes","Yes",1386521

But if they would reduce the payment to a reasonable amount, I could pay the note myself. Right now, my father is helping me pay the note so that our credit will not be affected. However, he is the only bread winner in his family, he has XXXX children of his own and is supporting his XXXX step-children with no child support from their father. So he is really not in a position to make payments. And why is this decision based on his credit score. That does not mean he is able to make payments.

"3139","3/28/2015","Student loan","Non-federal student loan","Dealing with my lender or servicer","Trouble with how payments are handled","I graduated from XXXX XXXX in Tennessee in 2010. I messed up my grades and lost some scholarships but continued my degree, financing with student loans, federal and private. After graduating, I discovered that they had been sold across the country and I was ineligible to consolidate them as my "" income did n't meet criteria. '' I began to pay on the student loans and have had several slight issues that were easily and readily remedied. Then, XXXX of my loan companies, XXXX XXXX, sold all of my loan portfolio that was with them to Navient. My parents, in an attempt to help me pay down my student loans had agreed to pay off my highest interest loan ( a loan with 14.25 % interest, compounded daily ). They made an initial payment to make certain that it would be processed properly, of {$500.00}, on said loan. That payment ( plus my payment for the month ), processed properly and was applied towards the loan which they determined, the XXXX with 14.25 % interest. Here 's where things took a turn for the worse. They made another payment of {$8500.00} towards that same loan, making certain to notate that they wished it to go towards the loan at 14.25 % interest. According to their website, it showed that I now owed something near {$400.00} remaining on that loan. I continued to check their website, to verify that it would stay processed properly for almost a week. The first day I did n't check is when that payment ( the second, {$8500.00} payment ) got reallocated towards all of the loans in my portfolio, according to some matrix that no one can explain to me. I did n't catch this until I logged in in XXXX to make a payment. I noted the difference and was on the phone with Navient within the week asking them to reapply the {$8500.00} payment solely to the loan with 14.25 %. Easily done, they assured me, and told me to check back within the week. I checked back, and sure enough, they had reapplied the {$8500.00} payment towards the 14.25 % loan, but now they had taken away the {$500.00} payment and reprocessed it towards all my loans, and the loan, which, when initial payments were made, showed less than {$500.00} left on the principal, now showed over {$1000.00}. Since then, I have talked to numerous associates at Navient and tried to explain the situation to them, and a variety of assurances and civility have been shown me, but nothing has changed in the standing of that loan for all the talking that I do with Navient. They have had my loans for 3 months, and they have been messed up for 3 months. My parents are trying to get a payoff quote to pay off the remaining balance, but it should n't be over {$1000.00}, it should be closer to {$500.00}. I have been put on hold for over an hour before they 've hung up on me and I 've been asked to call back and I 've been told that the "" line to the department who reapplies loans is down '' for Navient, and all of these have led this issue to continue, and I 've been told that it continues to accrue interest, compounded DAILY, while this issue continues to go unresolved.","Other","Navient Solutions, LLC.","TN","376XX","Other","Consent provided","Web","3/28/2015","Closed with explanation","Yes","No",1306018

I vividly recall the conversation I had when opening the account where the bank representative clearly stated the account would have no fees but failed to similarly clearly point out that however there would be a 3 % transaction fee for any international transactions on the debit card. I believe this is a deceptive practice, and not everyone is well versed enough to read all the fine print and disclosures to understand that these fees will occur. Had the representative made these transaction fees clear when I opened the account, I would have found an alternative method of paying for those transactions abroad. The bank refused to refund these fees on this basis, and I believe this is a deceptive practice and my fees should be returned.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","Bank of America","FL","335XX","Other","Consent provided","Web","1/13/2017","Closed with monetary relief","Yes","Other",2288490

The Aargon representative became aggressive and told me that asking for verification of the debt would take time, and kept pressing me to pay the bill. I refused, and told him that I wanted to file a dispute. He told me that was impossible, the bill was mine, and I should pay it. He told me that he could make a note on the file saying that I was in the process of getting an itemized bill from the vendor, but collections would continue. I asked him to transfer me to someone who could file a formal dispute. He told me that the manager was on break. I asked for a callback, at which time the manager magically reappeared. The manager told me that I had to request an itemized bill in writing from Aargon. I told her that this was not what the original representative told me, and pointed out that if I had not insisted on filing a dispute, nothing would have been done.

We were the victims of XXXX and subsequently were awarded money in a lawsuit that the CFPB brought against XXXX XXXX for Mishandled loan modifications and delayed short sales. Our case is simple we were working on a loan modification with XXXX XXXX XXXX who our mortgage was with and our credit report shows when the loan servicing was suddenly changed to XXXX XXXX. From there everything went downhill fast. We were told we had two miss payments on the loan to qualify for a loan modification or before they would allow a sale of the home. Because of this several sellers walked away and we had to take a much lower offer. For these reasons and many others listed in the lawsuit. I believe that this account now ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) should be deleted from my Experian credit report. XXXX XXXX XXXX changed names to XXXX XXXX XXXX. So the account on my credit report now shows up as XXXX XXXX.","Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response","Experian","KY","410XX","Other","Consent provided","Web","1/3/2017","Closed with explanation","Yes","Other",2273053

I reported this to the XXXX on three different occasions ; I am a co-Mortgagor. I was given different excuse for my name not being listed ; one was their system was only formatted for two names ; and here recently they said how the names were listed on the deed ; and as I explained to theme my name is visible on the deed and I need my name visible on all the documents. I live in the house my parents do not I handle all business regarding the home. One representative told me I need to assume the loan for my name to some on the loan ; I asked her why do I need to assume a loan I am already one. Every person you speak with gives you a different story. I spoke with the executive office they were very condescending ; I was told ; "" You want something you ca n't get ; '' and "" You ca n't always get what you want. '' I do not know why this representative felt he could speak to me in this manner was it demographics, gender, or bigotry. I have explained on several occasions to different representatives and the executive office if you are paying for something for the past 30 years you want you name to appear on the documents regarding that purchase. They could get my name on the payment coupon ; but when it comes to official matters regarding the house their system could not process all our names on the documents. I Was charged a late fee on XXXX 's Mortgage ; the payment arrived on the XXXX the office was closed a XXXX, and XXXX was the XXXX ; the payment arrived on the XXXX and the payment was not processed until the XXXX. They told me this payment was was late but previously I was told when a payment is due on a weekend the next business day the payment would be processed.

The consumer already got confirmation by the FTC., which would help deter time wasting and resource embezzlement that would harm the liaison and the cfpb examination process which in the long run would result in conflict of interest and procurement fraud.

XXXX XXXX advised me this was a debt collector and his intent was to collect a debt that had been sold several times from the originator "" Continental Financial, Matrix Credit Card. '' He stated I owed upwards of {$700.00} and he planned to seek legal charges ultimately resulting in me paying close to {$3000.00} in legal and penalty fees if I did not pay the {$700.00}. In the beginning, I informed him the debt was paid for less than what was owed ; until I went home and checked my records and discovered that I received a letter from Continental Finance ( CFC ) stating I was due a refund or at least since my account was a "" charge off '' left me to believe I was no longer responsible for the debt, because the letter from Continental Finance clearly states "" Charged-off '' accounts are accounts CFC determined are not likely to be collected and are closed to future charges. Since then, this account has been removed from my credit report as I assumed this was finally settled. Initially, I was in contact with several representatives from CFC such as collection manager "" XXXX '' XXXX XXXX ) and CFC representative XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ; FAX : XXXX ) advised him I was in possession of the letter from CFC dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX that originally explained the consent order and how the "" Charged-off '' account worked as described in the letter from CFC and the Consent Order from CFPB. I made several attempts to contact CFC directly ; however, they informed me they sold the account and they no longer could comment on the case I would have to contact the collection agencies to obtain information. I again talked to XXXX XXXX who informed me I was to send him a fax stating I had paid the bill ; however, when I attempted to explain to him the mix-up, he refused to listen and stated he was going to order his staff to begin the legal process against me by checking assets, financial and employment reports ; in addition, not only would this lead to increased fees, but criminal charges may also apply as well. I took this as a threat, even in the initial telephone conversation I was not able to give a full explanation concerning this issue as XXXX XXXX insisted on interrupting me with threats to pursue legal actions. According to your Consent Order to Continental Finance in XXXX Order to Pay Redress, item # XXXX ( XXXX ), ( i, XXXX, XXXX ), it addresses the issues of "" Charge-offs, '' if I am reading it correctly, this case should be closed and can not be enforced.

Over the last three years I have moved from being unemployed to underemployed and back again. I graduated with roughly {$100000.00} in student loan debt from various sources. For the federal and private bank loans I have been given forbearance and deferment. However for my loan through the XXXX ( {$39000.00} ) I was not granted the standard grace period of 6 months to 1 year. My loan with XXXX has since gone into default. The loan has now been handed over to the Law office of XXXX XXXX in XXXX, NJ. XXXX states that there is no loan rehabilitation with them and they wo n't help.I have emailed XXXX XXXX XXXX who is in charge of the NJ Class student loans and petitioned her to see if I could make a more reasonable payment. After speaking with the law office and making a good faith effort to start paying off my loan they did not give me a reasonable amount to pay. They were asking for nearly {$800.00} a month for 10 years which I could not possibly afford with bills and other student loans that I will have to pay. I now have a good job and would be able to pay them $ XXXX/month however they were not willing to listen. My sister was a cosigner on the loan and has also fallen on difficult times recently and they are garnishing her check. I am asking for any assistance you could provide me with. I worked very hard to graduate from a great university and financial hardships after graduation impeded me repaying my loan but I am willing to get back on track with a reasonable repayment plan. The law office now is not being responsive to my call or the calls of my sister, I believe that since they are garnishing my sisters check they do not want to speak.

Two of the reasons I was denied for the loan do n't make sense to me, I was told that I have bad credit with my Credit Union when I only have XXXX other accounts besides my checking and savings with them. XXXX is a car loan that I stay current with and the other is a credit card that I'am beyond my limit and making payments but the loan would rectify both of those! My debt to income ratio would change drastically if approved for the loan. I wrote XXXX XXXX with NFCU to see if I could file a complaint with them and have not heard a single word from them since. I read a story not that long ago about how XXXX XXXX XXXX has been discriminating against potential customers for mortgage loans. I originally brought my house for two reasons : one is to be able to pass it on to my children and the other was for an investment, and I ca n't even take advantage of it.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","Navy FCU","MD","207XX","Other","Consent provided","Web","10/7/2016","Closed with explanation","Yes","No",2152276

XX/XX/2016, I received a request for proof of hazard coverage for the property. I shared with the First National Bank representative XX/XX/XXXX that condominium associations were required to have hazard coverage in Maryland, but they required detailed proof of coverage. I am attaching the email that I sent on XX/XX/XXXX to our association 's management to request this document to First National Bank 's specifications. I have another email documenting that I received this proof on XX/XX/XXXX and forwarded the info to the fnbmort-online @ verifymycoverage email on XX/XX/XXXX as outlined in the letter requesting proof. I 'm also attaching the email response saying the document had been received and that I would be contacted if there were any questions. I received an additional letter requesting documentation and so I forwarded the email that I previously sent to the XXXXXXXXXXXX email again on XX/XX/XXXX. After I received the letter dated XX/XX/2016 which is attached, I called to report that I had sent the documentation. I spoke with XXXX at extension XXXX as I also documented on the letter attached. She stated that First National Bank was concerned that the document did not fully cover replacement of the property "" all in '' as I also documented in my handwriting on the letter. I then wrote an email to our property management company dated XX/XX/XXXX indicating that First National Bank considered the issue still outstanding and that more info was requested. Please see the attached documentation. I then spoke with XXXX and she requested that I fax the email with the additional clarification from our condo association to her which I did. You can see that I printed out this email on XX/XX/XXXX so that I could fax it along with the cover sheet. At this time, XXXX assured me that the situation was resolved and that I would not be charged for additional hazard insurance since I had provided proof to their satisfaction. I considered the matter resolved since she promised to contact me if there were additional questions. I also received a request from First National Bank XX/XX/2016 alerting me that the condo association coverage expired in XX/XX/XXXX and that they needed the updated policy. I have also attached that email request to our property management firm and the proof that I sent the proof of hazard coverage. On XXXX XXXX I received an escrow account notification of an increased monthly payment due to insufficient funds which included a "" MISC '' charge of {$1200.00} XX/XX/2016. When I called First National Bank to inquire as to the charge, they stated that it was hazard insurance coverage. I then spoke to XXXX and XXXX in the insurance division who variously said that First National Bank had not received any proof of coverage, had no documentation on my account at all, and had only received recent proof of coverage XX/XX/XXXX. When I stated that I wished to speak to XXXX, I was told that she was unavailable. I also requested the opportunity to submit this documentation and speak to a supervisor to resolve the situation. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a voice message from XXXX saying that they had received an email but that no policy was attached. I find this hard to believe given that they were clearly aware of the expiration date of the original policy that I sent based on their timely request for the renewal and the attachments that were clearly present in the emails. Based on the various answers that representatives at First National Bank have provided and their unwillingness to review my documentation, I no longer have confidence that they have any intention to refund the money that they have taken without cause.

However, when I contacted the Ohio Department of Taxation and the XXXX office they both stated that they do not provide verification to the credit reporting agencies. Therefore, it is not possible that Equifax was able to obtain the legally required verification of the record reporting. Upon contacting Equifax, on two separate occasion on XXXX/XXXX/16 and XXXX/XXXX/16 via certified mail, requesting that they mail a description of their procedures, indicating the exact name and contact information for the person responsible for verifying the record they were unable to provide anything. The FCRA requires credit agencies to disclose the procedure for obtaining verification. This is a clear violation of the FCRA. The two tax liens for {$3900.00} ( reference Number XXXX ) and {$630.00} ( reference Number XXXX ) should be immediately deleted without further need for investigation. I am not initiating a dispute. That has been done already and Equifax did not follow the law. This is routinely done by them and the CFPB should act immediately to prevent Equifax from listing public records for which there is not possible way that they could have obtained the verification.","Other","Equifax","OH","441XX","Servicemember","Consent provided","Web","11/4/2016","Closed with explanation","Yes","No",2197401

When I pressed the issue and asked for a supervisor ( XXXX, extension XXXX ) I was advised that the new card is a switch from an AMEX card to a XXXX card because they have switched programs. They said they sent me a communication on XX/XX/XXXX ( which I never received ) and when I asked for a copy of it they said they were unable to send it to me. I pressed the issue and they just said they were unable to send it to me. It seems that if they are claiming they sent something they should be able to provide me a copy. I checked their online messages ( which I rarely check, so could not have deleted ) and find there is only the message I received last night.

I have been enrolled part time since 2014. I called my school 's financial aid department and filled out an enrollment verification and the clearinghouse should have been updated of my part time status. I was provided with a copy of the verification. I received an email last week stating my AES account was still delinquent. They informed me that they were never made aware of my part time status and that to their knowledge I was still attending under part time. I spoke with a woman on the phone who said that my account could be deferred and that I would have to sign a paper coming in the mail. AES proceeded to deduct {$300.00} from my account the following day. I expressed to them in prior conversations that I am enrolled in school and am currently unemployed and can not afford to pay my loans at the moment and they still deducted money anyway. I was told by AES that I signed an authorization a few years ago allowing them to auto debit my account. My other qualm with this whole issue is that I was under the impression that I go into repayment 6 months after classes end, if they were made aware that I was no longer part time ( even though I am ), why was I not afforded that 6 month grace period? My checking account was overdrawn leaving me in a precarious situation with XXXX children to care for and living on XXXX income.","Other","AES/PHEAA","PA","190XX","Other","Consent provided","Web","11/16/2016","Closed with monetary relief","Yes","No",2211124

I 've been banking with Chase since XX/XX/XXXX and have been receiving my same deposits with no change being made, but as of recently someone restricted my account due to what I believe was a error of {$1200.00} through some type of remote deposit. I spoke with Chase and told them that had to be a error and the payment would be resent via direct deposit and they said okay but my account would remain restricted. I waited on my next deposits to come in and they were on time to meet my bills, but Chase said they decided to close my account so I said cool just give me my funds. I updated my direct deposit with my employer so no other funds would come to that account but {$23000.00} of my dollars still managed to go that account and here is where the problem begin. I was told my account was restricted and that a thorough review are done over each transaction going in and coming out so I had a ACH come in my account that was looked at carefully before being accepted. Chase took the {$1200.00} dollars that I owed them and said they are not giving me my funds because they are in my publishing and stage name instead of my government name but it 's been that way since I opened my account. I did everything I was asked to do from the back office to the branch but I ca n't seem to get chase to understand the illegal part of holding my funds for no reason so I spoke with my employers and they said well if Chase had a problem with the deposit why did n't they just send it back to us to reissue it and I told them what the XXXX told me which was it 's to late to recall the money once it 's in the account and it confused me and my employer for a XXXX to say if some money is incorrectly sent to a bank account it ca n't be recalled I 'm sorry but I 'm lost and had no other choice but to reach out to you or file a lawsuit and discrimination claim against these chase executives please assist me with this matter if you can.","Other","JPMorgan Chase & Co.","GA","303XX","Other","Consent provided","Web","11/15/2016","Closed with explanation","Yes","No",2210015

This came from the owner XXXX. I did not make any payments since I never got my tags nor coupon book not even the email confirming the credit. Then was getting calls that my car payments were late.

By that time they repossessed my car. This was just fraudulent and I do not believe they intended to do anything but get the car. Once they took the car, I was never informed of where it was to get any personal belongings, never told if sold or not, all communication basically stopped shortly after. I requested several times to go and get my things and also pointed out when am I going to get notice of 10 days prior to the sale and received nothing in return. Also one day the repossession fees are {$400.00} and then the next {$500.00}. How do they go up and I was told that the state only allows {$220.00} as well. In the contract you see my signature on one page and that is it. I do not recall if I signed more pages but I am sending the contract to show. On the check I gave them for the tags, the number came from them. On the registration, there is no late fees showing due yet they say I owed more and that was part of the problem. I was not going to pay more money to them just because they say I owed more when the number came from them.","Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law","TFC Group, LLC","CA","923XX","Other","Consent provided","Web","1/5/2017","Closed with explanation","Yes","Other",2224752

I was told that the escrow account will be calculated without tax abatement until the actual property taxes are paid so the bank would know how to adjust according. In XX/XX/XXXX ( after XXXX quarters of tax payments in ), I went to the branch to ask for an escrow adjustment, because the amount in my escrow account is really high and not based on real situation. The bank did an escrow analysis, but rather than lower my monthly payment, it went up by a lot while issued me a small surplus check which did not make sense. After several calls in the past 3 months with their escrow department, tax department and mortgage banking department, they still did not resolve this issue. I was passing from one department to another. Apparently nobody cares. As a result, I am overpaying thousands of dollars in my escrow when I should n't have to.

The bank charged an overdraft fee, and then XXXX additional sustained overdraft fees within 5 days of the initial overdraft charge, without notifying me of the first overdraft charge or giving me the opportunity to rectify the matter. Another deposit and charge was automatically debited to my checking account two weeks later which then triggered another overdraft fee. A total of {$160.00} was charged to my account without letting me know by phone, text message, or email that my account was overdrawn. I visited a branch and was told that my account is only eligible for a one time overdraft reversal so the initial overdraft fee no longer applied and I just have to pay the 2nd overdraft fee and XXXX sustained overdrafts ( {$120.00} total ) to bring my account current.

I spoke with a man whom I believe to be XXXX XXXX XXXX, about getting a installment loan on my XXXX XXXX, and pay off the balance of my interest only loan I had with TitleMax, on my XXXX XXXX, that I had taken out when my mother had past away to help pay for her funeral. I had an option when I did the loan at the TitleMax store located on XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Ga., to do an interest only month to month loan, or the option to pay over time with installments payments. I believe I was shown 2 options ( papers ), with scheduled payment amounts, how much each payment would be each month, how much would go towards interest, and how much would be applied to paying down the principle balance. The other option was just to pay interest only, month to month, and I understood and agreed to do the interest only loan. The lady that did my loan explained everything to me.I read the paperwork, signed the documents, and regretted not doing the installment loan because I have not been reimbursed from the estate within a month or so after taking out the interest only loan. I had thought I would have paid that off within a few months at the most when I took that loan out. I explained to XXXX XXXX when I called him on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, that I DID NOT WANT THE SAME TYPE LOAN AS I HAD ON MY XXXX. I was on my way to work when I called. He explained to me over the phone, after giving me directions to his location, because the Titlemax location I had used for the XXXX loan had closed or moved, and I had been making payments over the phone to this location every month, located on XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, Ga. XXXX. He explained to me that he could do a 12 month, or 24 month installment loan at around 8 to 9 % interest, and my payments would be around {$610.00} a month on a {$6000.00} loan for the 24 months and {$6000.00} is what he said I could get when he typed in my make and model and millage.I asked how long this would take because I was on my way to work, and he said about 20-30 minutes. The amount he said, the terms and conditions, payments, interest rate, was explained to me over the phone. When I walked into the TiltleMax store, XXXX was waiting on me, and all he said he needed from me was the title, my ID ( drivers license ). He went outside and took photos of my car, sent them to someone outside the store, on a cell phone. All I did was walk in the store and sat in a chair at his desk while he was sending whatever it was he was sending, and It was taking longer than expected, then they responded and he told me they are cutting a check for {$6800.00}. He asked me if all of my information was still the same while he was waiting on whoever to respond, I told him it was.He took a photo of me.I asked about paying off the XXXX loan, and he told me the easy thing to do would be to come back in once I cashed the check. I said thats it, and he said yes and handed me the check in the amount of {$6800.00}. I assumed I would be signing paperwork, and going over paperwork, but he did n't ask me to, and I trusted everything he told me to be correct over the phone. Everything is paperless now he said. I was late for work and I had no reason to believe otherwise. When I went back to pay off my XXXX and make a payment on the XXXX, XXXX XXXX was not there, they could only find my XXXX in the system, and then they found something that said I owed $ XXXX.The manger XXXX said that he did n't know anything about my loan, and said I could call and talk with XXXX XXXX the next day and he took {$820.00} cash from me. I asked for my paperwork and he just handed me a receipt and said he did n't know any details and XXXX XXXX could go over everything when he got in the next day.

The card had three areas of interest to be charged 1. purchases, 2. cash advances, and 3. balance transfers. The interest charges are as following purchases 9.49 %, cash advances started at 19.24 % now is 25.24 %, and balance transfers are 9.49 %. Each month the bill interest charges from all three categories which gave me my minimum billing amount with the principal amount only being applied to the lowest interest rate which would have been for the purchase. I had mostly used the cards for purchases but had a balance transfer of {$1500.00}. and a cash advance of {$1500.00}. never any more than those two amounts. Although the credit card company is charging interest on all three areas since there is principal amounts on all three areas an the bill is being paid on time although mostly at the minimum payment amount. Example of the charges interest charges for purchases were {$210.00}, interest charges for cash advances were {$27.00} and the interest charges for balance transfers were {$18.00} making a minimum payment of {$520.00}. allowing {$260.00} to go towards the principal for the purchase allowing that amount to go lower in principal amount. The problem that I have is that every statement that I have that shows interest that is being charge against the cash advance an is apart of each billing cycle that amount is being charged and then rolled over into the principal amount of the cash advance causing the cash advance to continue to increase without being used beyond the amount originally used by the card holder. Why should the amount being charged every month for the cash advance for interest and being included in the monthly statement as part of the payment an being paid within the billing cycle that amount is being rolled over onto the principal of the cash advance causing the cash advance to increase dramatically.","Other","JPMorgan Chase & Co.","IN","465XX","Other","Consent provided","Web","12/6/2016","Closed with explanation","Yes","Yes",2236639

"3852","12/6/2016","Mortgage","Conventional fixed mortgage","Settlement process and costs","Other","XX/XX/XXXX my wife and I entered a contract to purchase a home in XXXX and locked in a rate on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage with Citizens Bank, after extensively comparing rates and terms among lenders. We discussed with Citizens Bank the other options we had, and ultimately went with Citizens Bank because they were able to beat or match those terms and offered a lower overall rate and offered a locked rate so that we would not have to worry about any changes in rates before closing. We were to pay XXXX % down, have an XXXX % first mortgage ( 30yr fixed at 3.5 % ) and a XXXX % HELOC. Now, on XX/XX/2016, Citizens Bank has informed us that the HELOC can not be approved since I have a short credit history. This was clear from the start, and since then my credit history has actually become longer, not shorter, clearly. In any event, they now say that they can pass the HELOC to another lender that will lend at a somewhat higher rate, and that in addition to that the 80 % first loan with Citizens will now also have to be at a higher rate ( which makes no sense ). I believe the "" short credit history '' is a mere pretext to allow them to raise the rate since rates have recently gone up. We relied in earnest on their rate lock. Nothing since then has changed. The only reason they cite was a condition that was readily apparent from the outset and that has not gotten worse over -- it has actually gotten better if anything. Citizens knew that we relied on their representations in deciding to turn down other banks, and in paying the XXXX and XXXX deposits on the contract ( and in fact we sent these checks to them as proof of payment of these deposits ). They have at all points known that the rate was a material term to us, that we were relying on their representation that it was locked at 3.5 % and that their failure to conform their conduct to their representation will cause us a clear and significant detriment. Our detriment is not only the deposits and turning away other lenders but also the expenses incurred in inspecting the house and moving to close and the time we will have wasted if we do not close. My wife is XXXX and we would like to move before XXXX. Now we may be unable to do that. What is more, when they sent us the revised worksheet with the higher rate, they did not even mention that the rate on the first loan was in any way affected, but instead only mentioned changes to the HELOC. They sneaked changes into the worksheet for the first loan, and when asked about it they have tried to argue that the expense to us is now actually lower. This is plainly not true. We would like to have the HELOC approved. If they can not approve it at XXXX %, we might be able to make the XXXX % work ( by doing a larger down payment -- though we frankly do n't have the cash for that ) or we may be able to negotiate with the other lender to get an agreeable HELOC with them ( if we can get substantially similar terms ). But in no event is it fair or right for our locked, fixed-rate first loan to now become unlocked because my credit history is not long. They knew this from the outset and I believe they even mentioned it to me. I may even have an email referencing that fact.","Other","Citizens Financial Group, Inc.","PA","191XX","Other","Consent provided","Web","12/6/2016","Closed with explanation","Yes","Other",2235107

I use auto pay to pay this mortgage and when my interest rate increased in XX/XX/2016 ( XXXX ) they started calling from their collections department stating that I was not current on my mortgage, which was incorrect. I allowed them back in XX/XX/2016 to take the adjusted increased mortgage and was assured that they would not take my auto amount also. They deducted both so I told them to apply the original amount to principle. This started a series of journal adjustments to my account and now an entire payment is missing. In XX/XX/2016 I made my usual auto payment of {$1800.00}. In XX/XX/2016 the new amount of {$2100.00} was deducted from my bank account along with the {$1800.00}. In XX/XX/2016 & XX/XX/2016 they deducted the auto amount {$2100.00}. In XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX & XX/XX/2016 they deducted the auto amount of {$2100.00}. I have tried to work with Ditech but contacted XXXX when I realized that they were not crediting my account properly and my mortgage balance was higher after payments were credited. XXXX tried to get the information corrected but was unsuccessful. XXXX agrees that there is still an entire payment missing from my account history and the balance is incorrect but could not get Ditech to respond to their inquiries. Yesterday my representative with XXXX, XXXX, suggested that I contact CFPB to get resolution as she was unable to correct the information. Ditech has finally stopped contacting me from the collections department, which they never should have as I am current and have been as long as they have had my loan.","Company believes complaint represents an opportunity for improvement to better serve consumers","Ditech Financial LLC","HI","967XX","Other","Consent provided","Web","12/6/2016","Closed with explanation","Yes","Other",2238379

When I received my financial aid a month later I attempted to make my account current. The checking account had been closed and I had no path to make my payments. I called the local branches on multiple occasions, was connected to non-local branches on multiple occasions, went into the local branch, called the auto loan branch and there was no one willing to accept my payments, nor to simply reopen the checking account to let me then post my payment. Just short of two months later the car loan was closed in a defaulted standing. When approached by the auto loan/reclaim department of PNC, I was offered a repayment offer that would give me a lower monthly installment ( & lt ; $ XXXX/month ), which was not much of a shift from the original setup ( $ XXXX/month ... I always made payments of $ XXXX/month ). The intent was to "" reboot '' my loan, while not removing any of the default reportings on my credit. So go back to the status quo, but have a far less chance of refinancing with another loaner to get away from those that I now had sour business dealings with. I opted to make no payments and not divulge the location of my vehicle and now 2 years later ( with no payments! ). I approached the bank with a settlement option, {$3600.00} on the $ XXXX+ that was the remaining balance, no interest would be accepted on my part as I did not feel it was fair or in my best interest to include them in the base evaluation. My account has now been reported as paid in full on my credit report.","Other","PNC Bank N.A.","IL","618XX","Other","Consent provided","Web","4/5/2016","Closed with explanation","Yes","No",1865351

I decided this was a good option, especially since I like to pay extra on my principal each month and this would work out to have extra payment made each year. My first autopay was scheduled to come out XXXX XXXX. The email I received stated confirmed the autopay and stated that the full payment amount of XXXX would come out on XXXX XXXX. This made sense, as the full payment was due on the XXXX of the month. We noticed that only half the payment came out of our bank on XXXX XXXX. On XXXX XXXX I called Ditech for XXXX reasons : 1 ) the XXXX XXXX payment of {$620.00} was not applied to my Ditech account and 2 ) to determine if the remaining balance of {$520.00} should be paid to get the account current. Note : the next XXXX autopay dates were scheduled for XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX in the amounts of {$620.00} to provide an extra {$100.00} to the principal each month. When I spoke with the customer service representative, she did n't think a late fee would be charged since I was set-up on bi-weekly autopay. I asked her to check. She discovered that I did need to bring the account current, and I paid another {$520.00}, making my full monthly payment of {$1100.00}. She stated there was a glitch in the system, and that my payment should now post. I asked her to make sure that my next two payments would post as XX/XX/XXXX 's payment since I was previously told that early payments would be treated as extra payment. She assured me that they would be counted toward my XX/XX/XXXX payment. I spent 22 minutes on the phone with her and was assured that everything was fixed. On XXXX XXXX I called Ditech again after receiving our XX/XX/XXXX statement to ensure that everything was straightened out. I spoke to a customer service representative who assured me the payment on XX/XX/XXXX had posted to my XX/XX/XXXX payment, that I was current, and that my XXXX XXXX & XXXX payment should post toward my XXXX payment. On XXXX XXXX at XXXX a.m. XXXX, I called Ditech again to ensure that all was well. Ditech 's automated message stated my payment in the amount of {$620.00} was received on XXXX XXXX, and that my payment of {$2300.00} was due on XXXX XXXX, even though Ditech received {$2400.00} from me in XX/XX/XXXX for my XX/XX/XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX payments. I attempted to speak to customer service, but it said I needed to call during normal business hours. According to the Ditech statement and website, their Saturday hours are XXXX. - XXXX CST. I called back thinking there must have been a mistake as I was calling during their business hours, and got the same message. Unable to reach Ditech via phone, I emailed their customer service on XXXX XXXX and am still awaiting a response other than my message was received. I was unable to call Ditech on Monday or Tuesday ( XXXX XXXX and XXXX ) due to a business trip, but called them at XXXX. CST on Wednesday, XXXX XXXX. I spoke with XXXX in the Arizona office. He started looking into my payments, and stated "" I see that you decided to make incremental payments, is that correct? '' I told him that it was incorrect, as I set-up bi-weekly autopay and had paid my XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX payment in full. I spent 25 minutes on the phone with XXXX while he worked to figure out what had happened and why my account was showing {$2400.00} had not been applied and that I was 40 days past due, when I had called twice XX/XX/XXXX about this. He stated there were several changes in the company and that the department resolving customer issues was delayed in getting the issues fixed. He mentioned that a request to fix my account and payment issues was sent on XXXX XXXX and still pending. XXXX was going to send this to his supervisor with a request to escalate. I am supposed to check back in a week to ensure the glitches have been fixed.","Company believes complaint represents an opportunity for improvement to better serve consumers","Ditech Financial LLC","MO","657XX","Other","Consent provided","Web","5/11/2016","Closed with explanation","Yes","No",1920539
